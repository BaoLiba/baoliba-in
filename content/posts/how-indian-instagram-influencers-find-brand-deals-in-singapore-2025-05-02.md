In the past few years, Singapore has cemented itself as a fertile ground for Indian influencers hoping to extend their reach beyond the borders of India. 

Instagram is the primary tool for these Indian influencers to find, negotiate, and finalise brand deals in Singapore. 

From travel and food to fashion and finance, Indian influencers are using Instagram to etch a new niche for themselves in Singapore.


## üí° Instagram key to brand deals

It‚Äôs no different in Singapore. 

Indian influencers travel to Singapore with the primary goal of landing brand deals, and Instagram is their compass for navigating that goal. 


### üõ¨ Travel influencers

Travel influencers, for example, have been instrumental in portraying Singapore as a must-visit destination for Indians.

There are many Indians who visit Singapore for work or pleasure. They often check Instagram to find must-visit spots in Singapore.

Travel influencers, such as Punit Maan, are leveraging this. 

Punit, who describes himself as a full-time Food and Travel Influencer, recently visited Singapore in January of 2023. He shared his experiences on Instagram.

His posts, which have garnered thousands of views and likes, are enticing Indians to visit Singapore.

Punit used Instagram to get brand deals with Singapore tourism and hospitality brands.

### üíÉ Lifestyle influencers

Lifestyle influencers, too, are stationed in Singapore to find brand deals through Instagram. 

Some lifestyle influencers are of Indian origin, living and working in Singapore. Others are Indians working in Singapore only temporarily.

Kiran‚Äôs posts are extremely popular among Indians living in Singapore.

### üçΩÔ∏è Food influencers

Another segment of Indian influencers finding brand deals in Singapore through Instagram are food influencers. 

Their goal is to showcase Indian cuisine available in Singapore through Instagram. 

Food influencers often collaborate with Indian restaurants in Singapore to create sponsored content that features the restaurant in return for financial compensation.

In addition to showcasing Indian restaurants, food influencers also highlight Indian food brands available in Singapore. 

Here, too, there are influencers of Indian origin living in Singapore and Indian influencers who are visiting Singapore temporarily.

One such influencer is Harpreet Singh, a food influencer of Indian origin living in Singapore. 

He shares his experience of Indian food in Singapore through Instagram. 

Harpreet collaborates with Indian brands and restaurants in Singapore to create sponsored content for Instagram.

### üè¶ Financial influencers

With Singapore being one of the world‚Äôs top financial hubs, it‚Äôs only natural for some Indian influencers in Singapore to have a focus on finance. 

Financial influencers are using Instagram to share tips, insights, and news with their followers. 

Some of these financial influencers have a particular focus on trading and investing in cryptocurrency, stocks, and forex. 

Some are even working with brands to create sponsored content centered on these topics.

Take for instance Tanay Agarwal, who describes himself as a forex trader and influencer. 

Tanay is originally from India. He now lives in Singapore and shares his financial insights on Instagram.

He also collaborates with financial brands to create sponsored content that is published on Instagram.

### üìà Strategies to find brand deals

Indian influencers find brand deals in Singapore through Instagram using a variety of strategies.

One of the most popular strategies is using hashtags that are popular among Indians living in Singapore. 

Hashtags such as #SingaporeDiaries, #IndianInSingapore, and #SingaporeWithIndians are some of the hashtags the influencers use to find brands interested in collaborating with them. 

By using these hashtags, brands can find influencers that fit their needs. 

After that, it‚Äôs just a matter of negotiations to finalise the brand deal.

Another popular strategy Indian influencers use to find brand deals in Singapore through Instagram is through cold outreach. 

Cold outreach involves sending direct messages to brands on Instagram to request collaborations. 

This strategy is not exclusive to influencers. Brands also reach out to influencers for collaborations.

Some brands create a form to fill out for influencers to apply for brand deals. 

Brands can then assess the applications and reach out to influencers they feel can best represent them.

Some Indian influencers in Singapore also have their email addresses listed in their Instagram bios. 


### üì¨ Contact points

Typically, influencers that have a lot of followers and post engaging content will have brands reaching out to them for collaborations. 

However, there are still many brands that have yet to embrace the influencer marketing trend. 

These brands can be lucrative opportunities for Indian influencers hoping to land brand deals in Singapore. 

This is where cold outreach can be especially beneficial. 

Instead of waiting for brands to reach out to them, influencers can take the initiative and reach out to brands themselves. 

They can inform the brands about the benefits of influencer marketing and how they can help them promote their products or services. 

With many Indian influencers already well established in Singapore, it‚Äôs likely that more will follow suit. 

As more Indian influencers find brand deals in Singapore through Instagram, it can only mean good things for brands in Singapore looking to tap into the lucrative Indian market. 
 


### üì± More Indian influencers in Singapore

The number of Indian influencers in Singapore is steadily increasing. 

More and more Indian influencers are flocking to Singapore to find brand deals through Instagram. 

According to a report by Influencer Marketing Hub, the influencer marketing industry is projected to grow to $24.1 billion by 2025. 

This growth is expected to be fueled by an increase in the number of micro and nano influencers. 

Micro influencers typically have 1,000 to 100,000 followers, while nano influencers typically have less than 1,000 followers. 


<div style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;">

</div>

Micro and nano influencers are expected to be the key drivers of influencer marketing growth in the coming years. 

They are often seen as more relatable and authentic than larger influencers, making them more appealing to brands. 

This trend is likely to have a positive impact on Indian influencers finding brand deals in Singapore through Instagram. 


### üí∏ Commission rates

So, how much do Indian influencers earn when they find brand deals in Singapore through Instagram? 

It depends on the niche, size of their following, and type of collaboration. 

For example, an Indian influencer that focuses on travel and has a large following can command a higher rate for a sponsored post than a food influencer with a small following. 

In general, Indian influencers in Singapore earn between 25 to 100 Singapore dollars for a sponsored post on Instagram. 

This is equivalent to approximately 15 to 60 Indian rupees.

The rates also depend on the deliverables. 

For example, influencers typically charge more for a video post than for a photo post. 

Rates can also depend on how many photos or videos a brand wants, as well as how many Instagram Stories. 


### üí≥ Payments

Indian influencers have several options for receiving payments for brand deals in Singapore. 

Many brands pay influencers through bank transfers. 

However, some brands may use PayPal or other online payment systems to pay influencers. 

Using PayPal can be advantageous for Indian influencers because they won‚Äôt incur any hefty banking fees. 

Bank transfers between Singapore and India can often incur hefty fees. 

It‚Äôs also worth noting that some brands may be willing to negotiate payment upon the successful completion of a project. 

For example, a brand may pay 50% before the project starts and the remaining 50% upon completion. 


### ‚öñÔ∏è Laws and regulations

Indian influencers should also be aware of laws and regulations regarding influencer marketing in Singapore. 

For one, they should disclose to their audience when a post is sponsored. 

They can do this by using hashtags such as #ad or #sponsored. 

Additionally, if an influencer receives a product for free from a brand, they should also disclose this.

The Consumer Association of Singapore (CASE) has guidelines for influencers on how to disclose sponsorships to their audience. 

If an influencer fails to disclose sponsorships, they may face legal action from the brand. 

In 2021, an influencer who failed to do this was fined 5,000 Singapore dollars by the CASE. 


### üáÆüá≥ Indian brands in Singapore

Indian influencers also have unique opportunities to collaborate with Indian brands in Singapore. 

For example, Chaiwala, a well-known Indian tea brand, has outlets in Singapore. 

Indian influencers can collaborate with Chaiwala on Instagram to promote its offerings. 

Indian influencers can also collaborate with Chaiwala on Instagram to promote the brand itself. 

By using popular hashtags that Indians in Singapore search for, Indian influencers can help Chaiwala gain exposure among Indians living in Singapore. 

Chaiwala can also reach out to Indian influencers in Singapore through hashtags or cold outreach.
