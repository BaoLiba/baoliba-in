A recent report published by Influencer Marketing Hub revealed that WeChat has become a very effective platform for influencer marketing.

According to this report, for companies that focus on the Asian market, WeChat is a communication platform that they cannot ignore.

A Chinese app, WeChat is not only the top messaging app in China, but also the second most popular social media platform in the country overall. 

With over 1.2 billion monthly active users, 700 million daily active users, and 500 million users who regularly read articles on the platform, there is a huge opportunity for influencer marketing on WeChat. 


In fact, KOL marketing on WeChat is 25% cheaper than marketing on other social media platforms, while producing 300% greater engagement. This is why we have seen a rise in Indian brands seeking advertising and marketing solutions from WeChat influencers.  


But how much do WeChat influencers actually charge for their services? 

While pricing varies based on audience size, it can also depend on other factors. Let's take a look at how much these influencers charge for advertising on their accounts, and what factors determine their prices.


## ðŸ“Š The Prices Charged by WeChat Influencers

On WeChat, KOLs can charge anywhere from a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands of dollars for an advertising post.

Foreign advertisers must keep in mind that the pricing standards in China do not apply to the Chinese KOLs who do work for them.  

When Indian brands reach out to these KOLs, they must expect to pay anywhere from 20% to 40% more for their services, as the Chinese influencers have difficulty accessing Chinese payment gateways due to their IP addresses.  

Thus, they charge more to compensate for fees incurred when they convert payments made by Indian brands through services such as Paypal.  

The price for a basic advertising post can range anywhere from $200 to $700. A post by a KOL with a larger following can fetch between $800 and $3,200. 

A KOL with tens of thousands of followers can charge $3,200 and upwards for a post, with some charging upwards of $15,000.  

The total cost of advertising can also depend on the type of advertising. For example, KOLs that post advertisements on their official account, as well as those whose advertisements are published on a public or private group, can charge $500 to $1,500.  

Additionally, if the influencer's advertisement is also reposted on a social media platform such as TikTok or Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), this can add $300 to $700 to the total cost.

For a post on a second or third-party account, KOLs can charge anywhere from $300 to $2,600.  

KOLs can also charge for their advertising services based on how long their post remains up. For example, if an influencer posts an advertisement that remains up for 24 hours, they may charge $500 to $1,800. If the advertisement remains up for weeks or even months, they can charge $1,800 to $8,000.  


## ðŸ™Œ The Factors that Can Impact Pricing

WeChat influencers can charge thousands of dollars for their advertising services. But what exactly determines their rates?  

While the influencer's audience size is a key factor in determining rates, there are several other variables that can help shape how much these influencers charge for their posts. 


### 1. Audience Size

The greater the number of followers an influencer has, the more their posts can expose a brand's product or service to a wider audience.

Thus, influencers with larger followings can charge more for their services. 

While some influencers may have tens of thousands of followers, others may have millions. It is the latter group of influencers that can demand the highest rates for their posts.


### 2. Audience Engagement Rate

While having a large following is a great way to generate engagement, the actual engagement rate is what can impact how much an influencer can charge for their services.  

This is because brands are ultimately interested in how well their advertisements convert.  If a KOL has millions of followers but very little engagement, brands are less likely to use them to promote their products or services.  

Thus, influencers with the highest engagement rates can demand higher rates for their posts.


### 3. Industry/Niche

The type of industry/niche an influencer occupies can also impact how much they charge.  

Some niches can command higher rates than others. For example, a lifestyle influencer may charge $250 for a post, while a finance influencer can charge $1,300 for the same post.  

According to statistics published by HubSpot, finance influencers are among the highest-paid influencers across all niches. 


### 4. Authenticity/Quality of Audience

Sometimes, a KOL may have a huge following but their audience may not be genuine.

Some influencers may have a majority of their following consisting of bots and fake accounts. 

This not only lowers their engagement rate, but also their credibility in the eyes of brands.  

Thus, the more genuine an audience is, the more an influencer can command higher rates for their posts.  


### 5. Location of Audience

An influencer whose audience is based in the US can charge more than one whose audience is located in another country.  

This is generally due to the higher purchasing power of people in the US compared to other countries.  

Thus, a KOL whose audience is largely based in the US can command a higher price for a post, as they can guarantee that their posts have a better chance of converting.
