# How to Use ÂæÆ‰ø° for Business Marketing in China

The Chinese social media platform WeChat has over 1.3 billion monthly active users and is a powerful tool for marketing in China.

Due to its widespread use, WeChat is a critical app when marketing to Chinese consumers. 

In fact, 76% of Chinese shoppers make purchasing decisions via the WeChat app, according to a research report from Accenture.



## üì¢ Why is WeChat Important for Marketing in China?

WeChat is an all-in-one social media app that combines the features of Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and PayPal, making it a convenient platform for socializing, shopping, and online payments.

The platform has also evolved to become a powerful tool for marketers, allowing businesses to connect with their customers through personalized messaging, official accounts, and advertising.

WeChat is often considered the app that China built when other social media platforms were banned in the country.

Official figures from Tencent, WeChat's parent company, show that the app has over 1.3 billion monthly active users.

The app is used by 87% of urban Chinese Internet users over the age of 15 and 72% of total Internet users in the same age group.

Additionally, WeChat is a key part of China's economy, with 600 million WeChat users shopping via the app every week.


## üè∑Ô∏è How Do Businesses Use WeChat?

WeChat provides multiple ways for businesses to connect with consumers and promote their brands and services.

WeChat official accounts allow businesses to connect with customers, share news and promotions, and drive traffic to their websites. 

Businesses can also run ads on WeChat to reach a larger audience. 

When someone sees a promotional post from a WeChat official account, they can easily send a message, add the account as a friend, or make a purchase all within the app.


## üí° How to Market on WeChat

Here are some marketing techniques you can use to leverage WeChat for your business:


### 1. Create a WeChat Official Account

To build a presence on WeChat, your business needs to create a WeChat official account.  

Official accounts function similarly to verified accounts on other social media platforms.

A WeChat official account allows your business to post updates, promotions, and more to followers.

There are two types of official accounts you can create:  

**Service Accounts:** Service accounts have features similar to a personal account, such as the ability to send messages and friend requests to followers. However, service accounts are limited to four posts per month.

**Subscription Accounts:** Subscription accounts have a more limited feature set but allow you to send unlimited messages to followers.

To create a WeChat official account, visit the WeChat Official Accounts Platform and follow the steps to register.

Businesses outside of China may need to partner with a local third-party service provider to create an official account.


### 2. Optimize Your Account Profile 

Once your WeChat official account is created, optimize your profile to highlight your brand‚Äôs value.

Your profile should include:  

- Your business name
- A detailed bio that explains what your business does
- A profile picture that represents your brand
- Your website link
- Any other additional information that may be relevant


### 3. Post Engaging Content

Posting engaging content frequently is key to growing your following on WeChat.

Unlike other platforms, WeChat's algorithm has no exact formula for content engagement.

Instead, it uses a combination of factors to rank content. 

According to a report from Marketing to China, these factors include:

- **Page views:** the number of views each article receives
- **Likes:** the number of likes each article receives
- **Shares:** how many times each article is shared
- **Comments:** how many comments each article receives

Posting several times a week helps keep your brand top of mind for followers while boosting your algorithm ranking.

When posting on WeChat, remember that the platform favors quality over quantity. 


### 4. Invest in WeChat Ads

WeChat also offers several ad formats that provide businesses with paid advertising options to boost their visibility.

Unlike organic posts, ads on WeChat allow brands to reach more people and can drive traffic to a website where they can complete a purchase.

The three types of ads you can run on WeChat include:  

1. **Moments Ads:** Similar to Facebook ads, Moments ads can be displayed between user-generated posts on WeChat‚Äôs Moments feed.

2. **Mini Program Ads:** WeChat mini programs are sub-apps within WeChat. Mini programs allow users to do everything from playing games to shopping to ordering food. Mini program ads can be displayed in other mini programs.

3. **Banner Ads:** Banner ads can be displayed at the bottom of articles on WeChat official accounts.


### 5. Use WeChat Groups

WeChat groups allow users to connect with others that have similar interests. 

Creating a WeChat group for your fans can help build community around your brand and gives your audience a place to connect with you and each other.

A WeChat group can have up to 500 members, allowing you to connect with a large group of people.

WeChat groups have chat and video call features, making them a great way to host live Q&As or events.

To create a group:  

1. Open WeChat and tap the ‚ÄúContacts‚Äù tab.
2. Tap ‚ÄúNew Chat‚Äù in the top right corner of the screen.
3. Tap ‚ÄúGroup Chat.‚Äù
4. Select the friends you want to add to the group.
5. Tap ‚ÄúDone‚Äù in the top right corner.

To add more members to the group, tap the group name at the top of the screen, then tap ‚ÄúAdd Members.‚Äù


### 6. Partner with WeChat Influencers

WeChat influencers have built large followings and can help you reach more potential customers.

According to a report by The Drum, 59% of Chinese consumers said they are likely to buy a product after seeing an influencer promote it. 

Additionally, 84% of Chinese consumers trust influencers more than brands. 

Partnering with WeChat influencers allows brands to leverage the influencer's established credibility to promote their products and services.

When working with influencers, it‚Äôs important to allow them to communicate authentically with their audience. 


### 7. Use WeChat Pay 

In 2025, 86% of Chinese users are predicted to use their mobile phones for online and in-store payments.

While using WeChat for marketing, providing users with a seamless payment experience is crucial. 

WeChat has its own payment platform called WeChat Pay that allows users to send and receive money.

Brands can also use WeChat Pay to make transactions within the app.

WeChat Pay is the preferred mobile payment platform in China, giving your business an advantage over competitors who do not accept it.

Currently, WeChat has 63% of the market share, while Facebook only has a 6% share of the market.


## ‚ùó WeChat Marketing Challenges 

While WeChat is an effective marketing platform, there are still some challenges brands should be aware of.

Here are some of the challenges you may face when marketing on WeChat: 

- **Language Barrier:** The primary language used on WeChat is Mandarin. Brands unfamiliar with the language may struggle to connect with their audience.

- **Regulatory Compliance:** WeChat is regulated by the Chinese government, making compliance and censorship a challenge for marketers. 

- **Competition:** With millions of brands on WeChat, competition for user attention can be tough.

- **Third-Party Support:** Businesses outside of China may need to partner with a third-party service provider to assist with WeChat marketing efforts.

Understanding these challenges can help you prepare for success when marketing on WeChat.
