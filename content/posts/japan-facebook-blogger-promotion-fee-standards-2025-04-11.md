Influencer collaboration prices in Japan can be negotiated, so it’s best to prepare your budget based on the average range to avoid sticker shock when influencers reveal what they charge.

### 📊 FB Influencer Rates by Follower Count

When quoting prices, Japanese influencers typically reference their follower count. 

You generally get what you pay for when it comes to influencer marketing, so expect to pay more for influencers with sizable followings. You can see the average rates for each following tier below.

### 🏷️ Costs for Facebook Stories and Live Streams

Japanese influencers earn good money for Facebook story promotions and live streaming, charging between ¥20,000 and ¥50,000+ depending on their reach.

While one-off sponsored posts are the most common deliverable influencers provide, stories and live streams are also valuable marketing options that you should consider for maximum engagement.

### 🎁 Costs of Free Products

If you want to send your products to Japanese influencers for free, not everyone will accept them. 

In 2025, you can expect to pay an additional ¥5,000 if you want to guarantee that your product will be featured in an influencer’s post.

## 🏅 What Types of Influencers are on Facebook?

- Micro influencers: 5K-10K followers
- Mid influencers: 10K-50K followers
- Macro influencers: 50K-1M followers

Japanese Facebook influencers generally fit into the categories above, with most falling into the nano and micro influencer categories.
