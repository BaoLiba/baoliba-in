To promote products and services in China, businesses are increasingly using Xiaohongshu, known as Rednote in the Western world. 

Xiaohongshu is positioned to become the Instagram of China, and since it was founded, it has grown to become the fastest-growing social media platform there. 

It also boasts an average of 100 million monthly users who engage with over 1.8 billion videos a month.

In fact, according to a recent Alibaba report, Xiaohongshu is ranked second for the number one app Chinese women use for digital marketing, only behind WeChat.

Let‚Äôs take a closer look at how to use the platform for business marketing in China. 


üìª What is Xiaohongshu?


Xiaohongshu, which translates to Little Red Book, is a social media platform and e-commerce site that allows users to post short videos and photos featuring products they purchase. 

The content typically includes product reviews, how-to videos, and tutorials. 

Since it first launched, Xiaohongshu has grown to become one of the most popular social commerce and lifestyle platforms in China. 

It currently has over 200 million monthly active users, with 70% of its users aged between 18 and 35. 

The platform is also known for its loyal audience of affluent, urban women. 


üìà How Xiaohongshu is different from other popular platforms in China 

While Xiaohongshu has a similar look and feel to Instagram, it distinguishes itself from other Chinese social media platforms with a strong focus on user-generated content (UGC). 

This is particularly different from WeChat and Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok), which primarily focus on brand-generated content. 

In fact, Xiaohongshu‚Äôs content is made up of 90% UGC. 

The platform has also gained a reputation for having a more desirable user demographic that consists of younger and more affluent users compared to other platforms. 

Xiaohongshu users are also more engaged with content. 

According to the XHS Marketing Group, Xiaohongshu users are 30% more engaged with content than Douyin users and 50% more engaged than WeChat users. 

In addition, user loyalty on Xiaohongshu is higher than other platforms. 

According to the same report, 80% of Xiaohongshu users use the platform daily, compared to only 50% of Douyin users and 40% of WeChat users. 


üõí Xiaohongshu as a Social Commerce Platform 

Xiaohongshu is known for being a social commerce platform. 

This means its users can not only engage with UGC, but they can also purchase featured products directly through the app. 

According to recent reports, Xiaohongshu has overtaken Alibaba to become the top social commerce platform in China. 

It currently boasts over 200 million monthly active users (MAUs), with an average of 1.3 billion keywords searched per month. 

Xiaohongshu users also spend an average of 30 minutes per day on the platform.

Once a business account is created, companies can upload and publish videos and images, add links to their official website, and view analytics to track their marketing campaigns.
