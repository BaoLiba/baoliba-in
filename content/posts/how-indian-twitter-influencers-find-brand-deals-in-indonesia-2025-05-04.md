The bustling streets of Jakarta may seem worlds away from the crowded lanes of Old Delhi, but in the realm of digital marketing, distance is just a number. 

As Indian Twitter influencers look to expand their horizons, they are stepping into the fast-paced world of Indonesian brand deals.  Indonesia, with a staggering 23.9 million active Twitter users, serves as a lucrative market for Indian influencers looking to monetize their online presence.

### üåè Indo Twitter Is Wild 
Indonesia has a plethora of home-grown celebrities, social media personalities, and influencers. However, the grassroots approach of Indian influencers has garnered them a dedicated following in Indonesia. Some of their tweets even manage to trend in the archipelago.

The grassroots and often unpredictable nature of Indian Twitter has become a spectacle for Indonesian Twitter users to behold. The unique antics of Indian Twitter influencers have made them a viral sensation in Indonesia, leading to Indonesian brands seeking them out for influencer marketing campaigns.

The trend is not limited to just established influencers. Even unassuming accounts with a modest following are finding brand deals in Indonesia. Even meme accounts such as @IndoSonya, which has a following of less than a thousand, have collaborated with Indonesian brands.

### üíµ Payment In Bitcoin
While the digital world has significantly bridged distances in recent years, differences in local payment methods still pose a challenge for Indian Twitter influencers looking to land Indonesian brand deals.

While Google Pay and PayPal may work seamlessly for transactions within India, they are not widely accepted in Indonesia. The most common payment method for freelancers and influencers, especially those from outside Indonesia, is cryptocurrency.

According to a 2022 report by Chainalysis, Indonesia ranks first in the world for cryptocurrency adoption, with nearly 1 in 10 Indonesians owning cryptocurrencies. By using crypto to facilitate transactions, Indian Twitter influencers can ensure that they can receive their payments without any hassle or delay.

### üìà Indonesian Brands Have More Trust In Indian Influencers
India has become a powerhouse in the influencer marketing arena, home to hundreds of professional agencies, platforms, and talent managers. In fact, according to a report by RedSeer Consulting, the influencer market in India is expected to grow to a massive $2.3 billion by 2025, up from $1.3 billion in 2022.

This experience has given Indian influencers a competitive edge over local alternatives in Indonesia. 

A representative from the Indonesian influencer marketing agency 360 Influencer, who preferred to remain anonymous, stated that Indonesian brands often prefer Indian influencers as they find them to be more reliable than Indonesian influencers, most of whom they find to be ‚Äúfake‚Äù and less professional. 

### ü•á How Indian Influencers Can Secure Brand Deals In Indonesia
Despite the demand, Indian Twitter influencers cannot rest on their laurels. They must still proactively pursue Indonesian brand collaborations.

The first step in this process would be to create a profile on an influencer marketing platform that is popular in Indonesia. One such platform is Luvina, which goes by the tagline ‚ÄúYour Gateway to Indonesian Influencer Marketing Success.‚Äù 

Upon signing up, Indian Twitter influencers can browse through Indonesian projects in need of influencer marketing, submit their proposals, and negotiate their rates.

### ‚ùó The Language Barrier
Despite the promise of lucrative brand deals, there is a caveat‚Äîlanguage. 

To be eligible for projects listed on Luvina, influencers must have a minimum of 10,000 followers and post consistently in the Indonesian language. While many Indonesian brands are aware of the virality of English language posts, many still prefer local language tweets for their campaigns.

That said, there are no hard and fast rules in the world of influencer marketing. Some Indian Twitter influencers have found success even with their posts exclusively in English. However, they had to rely on their charisma and creativity to sell themselves to Indonesian brands.

### üö´ The Risks
The lucrative world of influencer marketing is rife with fraud, and Indonesia‚Äôs influencer marketing scene is no exception. 

According to a report by BukaReview, around 65% of Indonesian influencers have reported being cheated out of their fees by brands. 70% of influencers have encountered fake brands, and 40% have experienced contract frauds.

Indian Twitter influencers can protect themselves from scams by always asking for a fee in advance. If the brand refuses to pay upfront, they should request a partial payment. 

They can also use platforms like Luvina to connect with verified brands and agencies, ensuring that they land legitimate projects. 

### üì¢ Closing Thoughts
The world of influencer marketing is a dangerous one, but the rewards can far exceed the risks.  If done right, Indian Twitter influencers can secure lucrative brand deals in Indonesia.
