In the vibrant realm of social media, Yizhibo stands out as China's premier live-streaming platform, and a recent trend indicates that its influencers are increasingly attracting interest from brands in India.

Established in 2016, Yizhibo boasts around 35 million active users, predominantly young, with 90% aged between 18 to 34.

A unique aspect of Yizhibo is that its users are only required to complete a mobile number verification to access the app, fostering a sense of social intimacy and authenticity.


Since its debut, the platform has gained immense popularity, ranking first in the live-streaming sector as of 2022, and 16th among all apps in China, surpassing app giants like Uber and Netflix.

Yizhibo's rapid rise can be attributed to its association with China's youth culture. It's not just a platform; it's a lifestyle, offering a space where users can live stream their unique experiences, share tips and tricks, and explore the world through the eyes of peers.
