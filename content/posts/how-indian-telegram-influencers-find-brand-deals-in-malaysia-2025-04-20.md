When it comes to brand deals, Indian influencers are getting more ambitious. With the sheer abundance of telegram influencers in India, surely some of them must be looking beyond the subcontinent for potential collaboration. 

But if you think Indian telegram influencers would find it too difficult to strike brand deals in Malaysia, just wait until you see how much they can achieve with just a few taps on their smartphones. 

## üá≤üáæ Telegram is Popular in Malaysia

But why Malaysia? Well, for starters, Malaysia is a country with approximately 33 million people living there. With a sizeable Indian diaspora, which has accounted for about 8% of the Malaysian population since the late 1970s, there are plenty of reasons for Indian telegram influencers to target Malaysia for brand deals. 

Half of Malaysians already use social media. So to secure brand deals, telegram influencers must tap into Malaysia‚Äôs social media landscape, where telegram is also particularly dominant. 

According to a 2022 report by Statista, Malaysia has the highest relative number of telegram users compared to WhatsApp across Southeast Asia, making it the most telegram-centric country in the region. The report points out that about 53% of Malaysian respondents reported using telegram, up from 17% in 2020, while WhatsApp usage has stagnated at about 66%.

Malaysia is also ranked 2nd in the world for average time spent on social media daily, behind only the Philippines. 

## üì£ Indian Telegram Influencers Share the Same Market as Local Influencers

Malaysia is a very promising market because telegram is the social media platform of choice for both Malaysian and Indian influencers. This means that telegram is already saturated with creators, so it‚Äôs a field both Indian and Malaysian influencers understand. 

In addition to the time-tested process of influencer marketing, telegram has its own dynamics that influencers must navigate in order to monetize their presence on the platform. 

Telegram influencers can earn money through group subscriptions, where they charge subscribers a recurring or one-time fee to join their groups or for exclusive content. This is particularly common in Malaysia, where influencers charge up to RM30 a month on average. 

Although Malaysian telegram influencers are known for charging about RM10 per month on average, popular Malaysian telegram influencers can charge significantly more. Malaysian actor and comedian, Aedy Ashraf, reportedly charges RM5,000 for an annual subscription to his telegram group, which Aedy claims gives members direct access to exclusive updates about his upcoming projects. 

Beyond group subscriptions, telegram influencers can monetize their presence through advertising. Whether they have specialized groups or not, telegram influencers can promote products or services for other brands to their audience. They can also engage in affiliate marketing, where they promote a brand's offerings and earn commissions on any resulting sales made through their referral link. 

While Malaysian influencers may advertise to other Malaysian brands, Indian telegram influencers can promote Indian brands to consumers in Malaysia, and vice versa. This means that Indian telegram influencers are competing directly with their Malaysian counterparts for the same brand deals. 

In fact, there are many Malaysian brands who already collaborate with Indian telegram influencers regularly. 

## üáÆüá≥ Malaysian Brands are Happy to Collaborate with Indian Telegram Influencers

Indian telegram influencers have been promoting many popular Malaysian brands in recent months. In July alone, Indian telegram influencers promoted some of the biggest Malaysian brands, including 7-Eleven, 100 Plus, KFC, and Pappa Roti. 

The KFC and 100 Plus collaborations were particularly lucrative, as these Malaysian brands reportedly paid Indian telegram influencers anywhere between $60 to $300 per post. This also demonstrates the appeal of collaborating with Indian telegram influencers, as these influencers charge significantly less than many local Malaysian influencers, while having the same access to the Malaysian market. 

Though Indian telegram influencers don't just collaborate with Indian brands. Many Indian brands are interested in tapping into the Malaysian market, so Indian telegram influencers can also promote Indian products to Malaysian consumers.

Indian telegram influencers have also collaborated with Indian brands that have a strong presence in Malaysia. For example, Indian telco company Bharti Airtel partnered with local news channels and Indian telegram influencers to increase the visibility of their ‚ÄúAirtel 4G‚Äù offering in Malaysia.

According to Airtel, the campaign was particularly successful, as it resulted in one million new customers signing up for Airtel Malaysia‚Äôs services within just 4 months. 

## üí≥ How to Establish Brand Deals with Malaysian Brands

With a wealth of opportunities available in Malaysia, Indian telegram influencers should be keen to explore the Malaysian market for brand deals. 

Before they get started, Indian telegram influencers need to know the Malaysian laws surrounding marketing and advertising. While many telegram influencers may promote products or services without disclosing whether it‚Äôs a paid promotion, Indian and Malaysian telecommunication authorities state that this is misleading and that it constitutes false advertising. 

So Indian telegram influencers should indicate when they are being compensated for promotions in Malaysia by using disclaimers such as ‚ÄúPaid Promotion‚Äù or the hashtag ‚Äú#AD‚Äù that must be visibly placed within their post. 

In terms of collaborations with brands, Indian telegram influencers can reach out to Malaysian brands directly through their official contact methods, such as email or DMs. 

Many Malaysian brands will list their business emails in their Instagram profile bios. This means that telegram influencers can go onto Instagram to find brands that they wish to collaborate with, and send them pitches to their business emails. 

Apart from Instagram, Indian telegram influencers can also look for brands on other social media platforms, such as Facebook. One Malaysian brand, ‚ÄúD‚ÄôAnita,‚Äù a home care products company, actively posts about collaborations with telegram influencers on its Facebook page. 

Telegram influencers can also work with influencer marketing agencies in Malaysia. These agencies have established connections with brands, making them great facilitators for securing brand partnerships. 

## üí° Collaborate with Influencer Marketing Agencies that Specialize in Telegram

Influencer marketing agencies can help Indian telegram influencers find collaborations with brands across Malaysia. In fact, influencer marketing agencies can connect Indian telegram influencers with brands across the globe. 

One such Indian influencer marketing agency, BaoLiba, has already established partnerships with over 10,000 influencers in more than 100 countries. For telegram influencers, BaoLiba  specializes in helping telegram influencers secure brand deals worth thousands of dollars in the fastest time possible. 

Influencer marketing agencies can also provide a host of other invaluable services. One of these services is influencer protection, which is particularly beneficial for telegram influencers. 

With so many scammers operating on telegram, Indian influencers need to ensure that they are always protected when dealing with brands. An influencer marketing agency can facilitate a secure collaboration process between Indian telegram influencers and brands, ensuring that Indian telegram influencers are always compensated for their promotions. 

## üåä Use Local Payment Apps Popular Among Malaysian Brands

When securing brand deals across borders, payment can often become a hassle. Fortunately, Malaysia boasts many local payment apps that allow Indian telegram influencers to receive payments from Malaysian brands with ease. 

For instance, Malaysian brands can send money via the local payment app, GrabPay, which enables users to make payments, send and request money, and pay for online and in-store purchases. 

One of the most popular local payment apps in Malaysia is Touch ‚Äôn Go eWallet. This cashless payment app allows users to make payments securely and quickly, making it ideal for Malaysian brands to pay Indian telegram influencers through. 

Another popular payment app in Malaysia is ShopeePay. This app is specifically useful for Indian telegram influencers who collaborate with Malaysian brands in ecommerce, as ShopeePay offers discounts and cashback incentives for purchases made on Shopee. 

The success of Malaysian telegram influencers means that Indian telegram influencers have every opportunity to cash in on the Malaysian market for brand deals. All they need is a good strategy and a reputable influencer marketing agency to set them on the right path. 

## ü§î Are Telegram Influencers Legit?

Telegram influencers can seem suspect to some, especially if they engage in practices that many would consider spammy. Telegram influencers can grow their channels rapidly, boasting tens of thousands of members in a matter of weeks, prompting scrutiny into whether they achieve this through traditional means or through the purchase of fake members. 

The reality is that the massive saturation of telegram influencers, especially in Malaysia, has made the influencer scene on telegram rather chaotic. This has caused many telegram channels to become overrun with spam and hackers, leading some to question how legitimate telegram influencers really are. 

However, telegram influencers have a lot to offer brands looking for promotional collaborations. Unlike conventional influencers on Instagram and TikTok, telegram influencers can offer much more than just promotional posts. 

Telegram influencers can build telegram communities around brands and products, allowing brands to engage with their consumers personally. Many telegram influencers can even monetize their channels for those brands, managing the entire advertising process from promotion to payment collection. 

As long as they are mindful of the many pitfalls of telegram, Indian telegram influencers can set themselves apart from their Malaysian competitors, and develop a solid reputation as trustworthy and reliable influencers to work with. 

## üö´ Beware of Scammers

As promising as influencer marketing on telegram is, Indian telegram influencers should be aware that many scams are rampant on the platform. 

The most common scam involves hackers impersonating famous telegram influencers. They then contact other influencers, requesting them to send money for promotions. 

One famous Malaysian telegram influencer, Aisyah Safiya, has frequently warned about scammers impersonating her. In a post shared on her Instagram stories, Aisyah explained how scammers impersonate famous telegram influencers, including herself, to trick other influencers into sending them money. 

Another common scam involves people using fake telegram channels to promote products for sale. These bogus channels pose as official channels of popular brands to take people‚Äôs money. 

For example, one Malaysian coffee company, Perkasa Coffee, posted on Instagram about a company that falsely claimed to be selling their products on telegram. The company warned consumers that the telegram channel ‚ÄúPerkasa Berjaya Coffee‚Äù is not affiliated with them, and that consumers should not fall for the scam. 

## üåê Telegram Can Turn Any Influencer into a Global Influencer

Telegram is more than just a messaging app. It is a vast social media platform that allows anyone to build an audience and monetize their presence. 

Telegram has become the perfect platform for influencers because it requires little effort to create engaging content. And it‚Äôs easy for consumers to access that content without algorithms getting in the way. 

With the right strategy, it‚Äôs possible for any influencer to go from being big in their hometown to going global. Many telegram influencers have already achieved this status, so there‚Äôs no reason why influencers can‚Äôt follow in their footsteps. 

Whether they enter the Malaysian market or tap into another country, telegram influencers have the tools to grow their influence into a global phenomenon.
