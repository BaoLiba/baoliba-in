Despite the fact that Australian brands are pouring money into influencer marketing, there are Indian influencers who are finding success selling Australian products on Telegram. The fact that Australia is a developed market with high disposable incomes makes it a lucrative opportunity for Indian influencers. 

The Indian influencer marketing agency, BaoLiba, helps Indian influencers secure deals with Australian brands. 

## 🛩️ Indian influencers are flying down under

Over the last five years, Australia has been one of the few countries that has consistently attracted travelers from India. The Australian government recently announced that it would start offering multiple-entry tourist visas, allowing Indian travelers to visit Australia multiple times over three years. 

The announcement was greeted with enthusiasm by Indian celebrities. Karan Johar, who is a famous Bollywood filmmaker, said, “Australia has always been one of the favourite destinations for Indian tourists and Bollywood filmmakers. We have shot countless films in Australia and often visit the country with our families for holidays. This announcement will only increase the footfalls and will strengthen the bond between India and Australia.”

The Australian government is making it easier for Indian travelers to visit by giving them an easier time securing visas. Australian officials have also stated that they want to attract more Indian students and skilled workers. 

Indian influencers are taking note. 

“We have noticed that more Indian celebrities are visiting Australia,” said a spokesperson from BaoLiba. “And this is a trend that we expect to grow in the coming years. This is why our influencers are choosing to promote Australian brands. They want to be on the front lines of this trend.”

## 💸 Indian influencers are getting direct payments from Australians

Telegram is an encrypted messaging app that is popular in Russia and the Middle East. Indian influencers are adopting the app because they can avoid the costs imposed by social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook, which often take cuts of advertising fees. 

Instead, Indian influencers can simply ask Australian brands to pay them directly. 

One telegram influencer who goes by the name of “Bharat Bhai” uses his platform to promote Australian brands. Bharat Bhai charges a flat fee of AUD 10,000 to showcase Australian brands to his 2.5 million followers. 

Bharat Bhai told BaoLiba that he wanted to use Telegram because it allows him to keep most of the money he charges Australian brands. 

“Telegram is like a bank. It allows me to keep all of my profits, while platforms like Instagram take a cut of my earnings. Also, Telegram is easy to use, and it feels more intimate than social media. I can communicate directly with my followers, and I don’t have to worry about algorithms getting in the way. It also allows me to connect with my followers on a more personal level.” 

Being able to collect payments directly from Australian brands means that Indian influencers can expand their operations. 

“I have been able to hire my brother, and now he works for me as my manager. He helps me with my Telegram channel, and he takes care of all the deals with Australian brands. I pay him a salary of AUD 3,000 a month. Telegram has changed my life,” Bharat Bhai said.

## 🌏 Australia is a hot market for Indian influencers

Australia has a strong economy and a high standard of living. It is a developed market that offers many opportunities for Indian influencers. The Australian government has also been very supportive of Indian travelers and businesses. 

Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said that he wants to strengthen ties with India because he sees the country as a natural ally. 

“This is an important partnership for the future. It is important that we work together with India as a growing economy in our region,” Morrison said. 

In a recent survey by the Australian government, it was found that Indian travelers spend more than other nationalities. On average, Indian travelers spend AUD 5,000, which is AUD 1,000 more than the average for all travelers. 

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Indian visitors have contributed AUD 1.9 billion to the Australian economy. 

This is why Indian influencers are starting to promote Australian brands. They see that there is money to be made in this market. 

“The spending power of Indian travelers is significant and growing,” said Dr. Martin Kavanagh, who is an expert on the Australian outbound tourism market. 

“Research shows that Indians now spend relatively more than any other nationality in Australia - an average of AUD 490 a day. It is a premium market, and the Australian tourism industry must prepare for this surge in demand,” he added.

## ⛱️ Australians are traveling to India more than ever before

Many Australian influencers are also taking notice of India. There has been a noticeable increase in the number of Australian influencers who travel to India. 

This has been a boon to the Indian influencer marketing industry. With more Australian influencers traveling to India, there is an increased demand for Indian influencers to promote Australian brands. 

One Australian influencer who recently visited India is Justin Martin. Justin Martin is a travel influencer who hails from Sydney. He has a following of over 500,000 on Instagram. 

He recently visited India to promote a travel company called Backpackers World. The owner of the company, Aidan Fulcher, said that he was excited to work with Justin because he has a large following and is a well-respected travel influencer.  

“Justin has a great following, and many of his audience members are looking for travel inspiration. He has traveled to many countries, and he has a lot of experience in the travel industry,” Fulcher said. 

“I was thrilled when he said he wanted to come to India. India is a fantastic country with a lot of history and culture, and it is a great destination for backpackers. He did a great job promoting our company, and I am sure that we will see an influx of Australian backpackers as a result,” he added.

## ❗ Telegram influencers should be wary of scams

Although Telegram allows influencers to connect directly with their audience, it also has a downside. Telegram is not as heavily moderated as other social media platforms. This means that influencers have to be careful about whom they do business with. 

“Scammers are everywhere, and they are always looking for opportunities to exploit unsuspecting victims,” said a spokesperson from BaoLiba. 

“This is why influencers need to be careful about whom they do business with. They should do their due diligence and investigate any potential clients before agreeing to work with them,” the spokesperson added.

Telegram influencers should also be wary of fake accounts. Fake accounts are often created by scammers in order to impersonate real influencers. These fake accounts can mislead brands and cause them to lose money. 

“Influencers should verify their accounts on Telegram. This will help them stand out from the crowd and make it easier for brands to find them,” the spokesperson from BaoLiba said.

## 🔮 Conclusion

The Indian influencer marketing industry is on the rise, and Australian brands are beginning to take notice. Telegram influencers are starting to promote Australian brands and make a name for themselves in the process. 

With more Indian influencers promoting Australian brands and more Australian influencers traveling to India, it is clear that this trend is here to stay.
