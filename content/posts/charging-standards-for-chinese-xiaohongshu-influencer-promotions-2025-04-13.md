The price can vary significantly depending on the influencer's reach. A flat fee for a product review can cost anywhere from $50 to $2,000.

2. **Video Showcase**

Many Xiaohongshu influencers combine product reviews with video showcases. Xiaohongshu users tend to engage with videos more than images.

## üè∑Ô∏è Paid Collaborations vs Unpaid Collaborations

Most Xiaohongshu influencers prefer paid collaborations. They tend to avoid unpaid collaborations because many brands lack a proper marketing strategy.

However, different influencers have different methods of collaboration. Some Xiaohongshu influencers might agree to unpaid collaborations, while others might not. 

Unpaid collaborations can also have different structures. Some Xiaohongshu influencers might only ask for products. Others might seek a commission on sales generated from their referrals. 

1. **Products Only**

Some Xiaohongshu influencers accept products instead of cash for collaborations. They will usually ask for products worth the same amount they would charge for their services. For example, if a Xiaohongshu influencer charges $100 for a post, they will only accept products worth $100 for a collaboration.

2. **Commission Only**

Some Xiaohongshu influencers will only accept a commission on sales they generate. They will ask for a unique referral code or link to track sales. 

For instance, if a Xiaohongshu influencer has 5% of their audience convert on a $20 product, they would earn $1 for every product sold. If the influencer generates 100 sales, they would earn $100 in commission.

3. **Products and Commission**

There are also Xiaohongshu influencers who will only collaborate for a combination of products and commission. They will ask for products and a commission on sales they generate.

Some influencer management agencies charge a retainer fee for their services. They will have brands sign a contract, and brands will pay a monthly fee. 

Retainer fees can vary from $300 to $1,000 per month. Influencer management agencies that charge retainer fees will usually have different packages. The more expensive packages will likely provide more influencers for collaborations.

2. **Commission-Based Fee**

Other influencer management agencies charge fees based on the sales generated from influencer collaborations. For example, if a Xiaohongshu influencer sells 100 products worth $20 each, the total sales would generate $2,000. 

If the influencer management agency has a 15% commission, they would earn $300 from the sales. Brands can save money by paying a commission-based fee, but they might spend more if many sales are generated.

3. **Flat Fee**

Lastly, some influencer management agencies charge a flat fee for their services. They usually charge a single fee for collaboration with a Xiaohongshu influencer.

There are many influencer management agencies in India that will help brands and Xiaohongshu influencers sign contracts. However, many small to medium-sized brands may not want to work with influencer management agencies. 

Brands can use influencer contract templates available online and customize them to their needs.

## üìå Track Metrics

Brands that collaborate with Xiaohongshu influencers need to track certain metrics. Tracking metrics will determine whether influencer collaborations are effective or not. 

1. **Engagement Rate**

The engagement rate measures the number of people who engage with a post compared to how many followers the influencer has. A higher engagement rate means a more engaged audience, which leads to more sales. 

A Xiaohongshu influencer's engagement rate can be calculated by using the following formula:

\[\text{Engagement Rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Likes} + \text{Comments}}{\text{Followers}} \right) \times 100\]

For example, if a Xiaohongshu influencer has 100 likes and 10 comments on a post, their engagement rate will be calculated as follows:

\[\text{Engagement Rate} = \left( \frac{100 + 10}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 5.5\%\]

If a Xiaohongshu influencer has an engagement rate between 1% to 5%, they have a decent audience. However, if a Xiaohongshu influencer has an engagement rate above 5%, they have a highly engaged audience.

2. **Traffic**

Tracking traffic is essential for brands collaborating with Xiaohongshu influencers. Knowing how much web traffic is generated from influencers will determine how effective they are. 

Brands can track how much traffic Xiaohongshu influencers generate by using UTM tags. UTM tags are special codes that you attach to a URL that you want to track. 

For example, a brand can add the following UTM code to their website URL: 

```
https://www.example.com/?utm_source=xiaohongshu&utm_medium=influencer&utm_campaign=product_launch
```

The UTM code will track how many users clicked that specific link. Brands can analyze the UTM code data within web analytics tools like Google Analytics.

3. **Sales**

Finally, brands should track how many sales Xiaohongshu influencers generate. Tracking sales will determine whether influencer collaborations are worth the money or not. 

Brands can track sales using the same UTM tags mentioned previously. Brands can also give Xiaohongshu influencers discount codes or referral codes to track sales. 

For example, if a Xiaohongshu influencer has a referral code called "DREAMY10," they will earn 10% of a sale for every customer that uses the code. 

Xiaohongshu influencers can also embed their referral codes in links to track sales. For example, brands can provide a link like the following: 

```
