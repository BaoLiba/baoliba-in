The world of influencer marketing is constantly evolving, creating new trends and opportunities for brands and individuals alike.

One of the latest‚Äîmost surprising and certainly intriguing‚Äîtrends to emerge from the world of Snapchat influencers in India is their tendency to promote Bangladeshi products and services, enabling brands in Bangladesh to reach untapped audiences in India.

This trend has created a growing market for Bangladeshi brands to promote themselves through Indian Snapchat influencers, who have become the go-to bridge for Bangladeshi brands to access the lucrative Indian market.

But how exactly are Indian Snapchat influencers going about securing these lucrative deals? And just what is it that‚Äôs drawing Bangladeshi brands to India‚Äôs Snapchat influencers?

In this article, we will uncover these questions and more, exploring the market for Bangladeshi brand deals for Indian Snapchat influencers and how they‚Äôve become the preferred choice for securing brand deals.

## üìà The Bangladeshi Market for Snapchat Influencer Marketing in India

Before we explore how Indian Snapchat influencers are securing brand deals with Bangladeshi brands, it‚Äôs important to first establish just how lucrative the Bangladeshi market for Instagram influencer marketing in India is.

While influencer marketing is a well-established field in India, the trends of Bangladeshi brands targeting Indian social media influencers is relatively new. Studies show that Bangladeshi brands are prioritizing Indian influencers over local ones. 

According to a 2022 report by the Internet and Mobile Association of Bangladesh (IMAB), 78 percent of Bangladeshi brands reported working with Indian influencers for their marketing efforts, with only 22 percent opting to work with local influencers.

Notably, Snapchat is the most preferred social media platform utilized by Bangladeshi brands in their influencer marketing strategies, with brands preferring SnapChat influencers over those on Facebook and Instagram. 

The report also highlights that 61 percent of Bangladeshi brands prefer influencer marketing over traditional marketing methods, while 78 percent of Bangladeshi brands report a positive return on investment from their influencer marketing activities.

This trend is going to continue growing, as another report has shown that the influencer marketing industry in Bangladesh alone is expected to reach $70 million by 2025.

This growing market is the perfect opportunity for Indian influencers on Snapchat to cash in, as Bangladeshi brands scramble to find Indian influencers to partner with.

## üåç Why Are Bangladeshi Brands Targeting Indian Influencers?

So, why are Bangladeshi brands so interested in partnering with Indian influencers, particularly Snapchat influencers? 

For one, the fact that Snapchat is one of the most popular social media apps among young people in Bangladesh creates a natural correlation with Indian influencers, who are better suited to appeal to young audiences. 

According to Datareportal, 43.4 percent of Bangladeshis aged 16 to 24 use Snapchat. This is significantly higher than the global average of 14.5 percent in the same age group. According to another report, Snapchat is the 5th most popular social media app in Bangladesh, with over 8 million users in the country.

Snapchat is also the most-used social media app in Bangladesh, as Bangladeshi youth have been found to be particularly responsive to Snapchat‚Äôs unique ephemeral content style, which is perfect for influencer promotions.

Another reason Bangladeshi brands are turning to Indian influencers is the underlying cultural and social similarities between the two countries. 

India and Bangladesh share similar historic socio-cultural ties, with many similarities in language, popular culture, and food. These underlying similarities make it easier for Bangladeshi brands to connect with Indian influencers.

## üí∞ How Much Do Indian Snapchat Influencers Earn from Bangladeshi Brand Deals?

With the solid market for Snapchat influencer marketing in Bangladesh, the question must be asked; how much are Indian Snapchat influencers earning from Bangladeshi brand deals?

While it‚Äôs difficult to provide average earnings for Indian Snapchat influencers promoting Bangladeshi brands, anecdotal evidence suggests that their earnings can be quite significant.

According to a report by The Dhaka Tribune, influencers with around 5,000 followers can earn around BDT 1,500 to BDT 3,000 ($14 to $28) per post. Influencers with around 100,000 followers can charge around BDT 5,000 to BDT 15,000 per post. 

However, those numbers can be quite different, as many Indian Snapchat influencers report earning amounts significantly higher than those mentioned. 

According to one Indian Snapchat influencer promoting Bangladeshi brands, influencers with around 100,000 followers can charge around BDT 20,000 to BDT 50,000 ($185 to $462) per post. 

Still, the earnings can vary widely, as they are influenced by various factors such as niche and engagement rates. Influencers belonging to the fashion niche can earn around 60-80 percent more than influencers from other niches.

These higher earnings are made possible by the fact that Bangladeshi brands are willing to pay higher amounts to Indian influencers compared to local influencers in Bangladesh. 

In fact, the Dhaka Tribune report states that Bangladeshi brands pay around 25 to 40 percent more to Indian influencers, meaning Indian Snapchat influencers can earn even more for Bangladeshi brand deals.

## üîë How Indian Snapchat Influencers Are Securing Brand Deals with Bangladeshi Brands

Given the lucrative market for Snapchat influencer marketing in Bangladesh and the higher amounts paid to Indian influencers, it‚Äôs no surprise that Indian Snapchat influencers are making a concerted effort to connect with Bangladeshi brands.

But how exactly are Indian Snapchat influencers going about securing brand deals with Bangladeshi brands?

According to reports, many Indian influencers are using online creator platforms to connect with Bangladeshi brands looking to partner with influencers. 

Creator platforms are online marketplaces that connect brands with influencers, providing brands with a wide pool of influencers to choose from to suit their needs. Brands can also find influencers easily through creator platforms, as they are equipped with search filters to help them narrow down their influencer choices based on factors such as niche and audience demographics.

Influencer marketing agencies are another type of platform that Indian influencers are using to connect with Bangladeshi brands. 

Many of these creator platforms and influencer marketing agencies are dedicated to niche influencer marketing. This means they focus on connecting brands with influencers in a specific niche, such as food or beauty. 

These specialized platforms allow Indian influencers to find Bangladeshi brands that align with their niche, making it easier for them to secure brand deals.

It‚Äôs also important to note that English is one of the most widely spoken languages in Bangladesh, which means Indian influencers can communicate with Bangladeshi brands without any issues.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è How Indian Snapchat Influencers Are Getting Paid for Bangladeshi Brand Deals

While Indian Snapchat influencers are securing brand deals with Bangladeshi brands, another important question must be asked; how are they getting paid?

One of the biggest challenges that Indian Snapchat influencers face when getting paid for brand deals with Bangladeshi brands is the differences in currency and payment methods. 

Fortunately, popular international money transfer apps such as PayPal and Western Union allow Bangladeshi brands to send payments to Indian influencers without any issues.

According to the Dhaka Tribune report, PayPal is the most preferred payment method for Indian influencers working with Bangladeshi brands. 

Meanwhile, Western Union is the most popular payment method for local Bangladeshi influencers working with local Bangladeshi brands, with an overwhelming majority of 80 percent preferring it.

## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Why Are Bangladeshi Brands Choosing Indian Influencers Over Local Ones?

While Indian Snapchat influencers are certainly benefiting from the trend of Bangladeshi brands partnering with influencers, it must be asked; why are Bangladeshi brands choosing Indian influencers over local influencers?

As mentioned earlier, the cultural similarities between India and Bangladesh create a natural connection that makes Indian influencers more relatable to Bangladeshi audiences.

Another reason is that Indian influencers are better equipped to create unique and engaging content due to their high level of creativity. 

For instance, Indian influencers have been known to create higher-quality videos, using advanced gear and editing techniques, making their videos much more compelling.

## üîç Conclusion

The trend of Bangladeshi brands partnering with Indian Snapchat influencers to promote their products and services is one of the most interesting emerging trends in the world of influencer marketing today.

Indian Snapchat influencers are capitalizing on the lucrative market for influencer marketing in Bangladesh, as the majority of Bangladeshi brands are now opting to work with Indian influencers instead of local ones. 

This trend is expected to continue growing, as influencer marketing is expected to reach $70 million in Bangladesh by 2025.

With the ability to earn significant amounts from brand deals and the relative ease of securing them, Indian Snapchat influencers will likely continue to strengthen their position as the go-to choice for Bangladeshi brands looking to reach Indian audiences.
