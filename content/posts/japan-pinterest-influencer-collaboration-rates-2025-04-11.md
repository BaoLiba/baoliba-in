Collaborating with Pinterest influencers from India can help elevate your marketing strategy, but the rates may send chills down your spine. 

According to preliminary reports, Indian Pinterest influencers charge anywhere between ‚Çπ4,500 to a whopping ‚Çπ24,000 per pin. 

With Indian Pinterest influencers trending up to become one of the most sought-after marketing channels in 2025, it is crucial you understand the pricing mechanism for your next collaboration.

## üìå Pinterest Marketing in India

Pinterest is a virtual bulletin board where users can pin ideas that resonate with them. The platform has evolved to house the most vibrant social commerce and influencer marketing ecosystem in the world. 

Pinterest marketing is an unconventional form of marketing that is yet to make significant inroads in India. While more than 80% of Indian consumers are aware of Pinterest, around 70% do not currently use the platform. 

For users that have the app, over 40% report visiting Pinterest daily and on average spend well over 14 minutes per session. 

Currently India has close to 15 million Pinterest users with over 70% of them being women. 

This indicates a huge opportunity for brands looking to bypass the heavy male domination of most Indian social media platforms.

When examining your target audience, Pinterest dominates social media engagement for people aged between 25-44 years, being the only platform that has remained consistently high across this whole age category. 

## üìä Pinterest Collaboration Pricing in India

Pricing among Indian Pinterest influencers cannot be regarded as a flat rate. Multiple factors determine the final cost including follower count, engagement rate, niche, brand affiliation and the nature of the collaboration.

### üí∞ Collaboration Pricing

The following prices are average rates charged by Pinterest influencers from India; 

1. **Sponsored Pin Creation and Pinning:**  ‚Çπ4500 to ‚Çπ8000
2. **Video Pin Creation and Pinning:** ‚Çπ8000 to ‚Çπ12,000
3. **Slide Pin Creation and Pinning:**  ‚Çπ7000 to ‚Çπ10,000
4. **Idea Pin Creation and Pinning:** ‚Çπ8000 to ‚Çπ16,000
5. **Community Pin Creation and Pinning:** ‚Çπ5000 to ‚Çπ24,000 

### üßÆ Factors Affecting Pricing

The two most important metrics for determining pricing among influencers is typically their follower count and engagement rate. 

Pinterest influencers primarily charge per pin, and the average price can be calculated by dividing the number of monthly unique views by ten.

1. **Followers:** The wider your reach, the more expensive your service. Influencers with follower counts ranging from 1000 to 10000 charge between ‚Çπ2000 to ‚Çπ5000 per pin. 
2. **Engagement Rate:** The degree of interaction with your audience is equally important. Influencers with over 200 monthly unique views are likely charging ‚Çπ5000 to ‚Çπ8000 per pin. 

Other factors that also influence the final pricing include;

3. **Niche:** Product categories that have a visible presence within Pinterest can command higher prices. Crafts & DIY, Home, Garden, and Style categories are traditionally the most popular areas in Pinterest.
4. **Affiliation and Partnership:** Pinterest business accounts tend to charge higher than personal accounts. Premium brands can also negotiate higher rates and demand more creative control over the content.
5. **Pin Format:** Pinterest offers multiple formats for pins. Idea pins have gained popularity in Indian Pinterest marketing recently due to their immersive storytelling format. They are also structured like reels on Instagram, which is another key reason for their popularity.

## ü§ù Collaboration Types

Pinterest features a plethora of content types. As previously mentioned, the format you choose plays a huge role in determining the pricing. 

All price ranges mentioned above are for a single pin. The average influencer herein tends to charge three times for the same service when creating multiple pins in a one day span.

### üìå Content Promotion

Promoting your content has been the central function of Pinterest since its inception. Your average knowledgeable influencer may propose to create up to five standard pins across ten boards.

This entails creating the pin, embedding links, optimizing titles, descriptions, and also covers for the pins. Depending on the number of boards they cover, prices can range from ‚Çπ10,000 to ‚Çπ30,000.

### üìà Brand Partnership

Due to Pinterest‚Äôs unique audience, the platform is increasingly becoming a land of opportunity for brands. Multi week and multi month partnerships are becoming commonly sought after by brands.

Such arrangements can start from ‚Çπ50,000, range upwards of ‚Çπ100,000 and can even reach ‚Çπ200,000 or more.

### üìΩÔ∏è Idea Pin Partnerships

As mentioned earlier, idea pins are fast becoming one of the most sought after collaborations in the platform. Similar to TikTok‚Äôs reach and Instagram‚Äôs reels, these pins can feature upto twenty frames of video and still images packed with interactive elements.

They can be pinned across ten boards, people can react and reach out directly to influencers about products they are interested in from within the pin itself, and they are available for a longer period compared to standard pins. 

Despite the ambiguous pricing, Indian Pinterest influencers are likely charging upwards of ‚Çπ150,000 for idea pin partnerships.

In addition to dollars, multiple products and travel expenses are also common in such partnerships.

## üìä Pricing Analytics

While influencers on Pinterest can be more cost effective than other platforms, such as Instagram, it pays to be cautious. 

A survey conducted by Baoliba indicated that a staggering 78% of influencers on Pinterest are either unaware or unsure of how to monetize their accounts. 

### ‚ùó Caution

While gauging influencer pricing, brands should be aware of the fraud associated with influencer marketing. 

Chances of influencers misrepresenting their follower counts or engagement are rife. Influencers can manipulate their account to achieve higher follower counts through a variety of methods, such as;

1. **Faking Followers:** Faking followers is the act of artificially boosting your follower count using networks of bots. 
2. **Manipulating Analytics:** Influencers can create a new account and use it to engage with their content, thereby inflating their analytics, making their account appear more influential than it is.
3. **Buying Likes and Followers:** Services such as SocialBuddy and SocialPackages allow users to artificially inflate their follower count for a fee.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Recourse

Legal recourse is available under the Indian Penal Code and the Indian Information Technology Act in case you have been the victim of fraud. 

Under Section 66 of the Indian Information Technology Act, the penalty for hacking is up to ‚Çπ1 million fine and/or imprisonment of up to three years.

However, legal recourse is insufficient unless there is a proper contract in place with an influencer. 

Securing a solid influencer marketing contract is absolutely crucial to protecting yourself and your brand. 

An influencer marketing contract should include the following;

1. **Services Provided:** Defined services including all deliverables such as the number of pins and boards pinned. 
2. **Payment Terms:** Payment structure including amount, method and duration. 
3. **Contract Term:** This should include the length of the campaign as well as the amount of time they have to fulfill their end of the bargain. 
4. **Confidentiality Clause:** This should include all confidential information such as payment amounts as well as trade secrets. 
5. **Intellectual Property Rights:** Detailed ownership of the content produced. 
6. **Termination Clause:** Conditions allowing either party to terminate the contract.

## üëÄ Conclusion

Pinterest influencers are rising in stature among Indian brands. Pinterest in itself, is also trending upwards to become one of the most used platforms amongst Indian consumers.

Despite the ambiguous rates charged by influencers, it can be inferred that collaborations on the platform are generally cheaper than other more popular platforms among influencers. 

Brands must adopt due diligence when assessing influencers to partner with. Artificial inflation of accounts is rife on social media platforms. 

Contracts are also crucial, as they provide legal recourse should you become a victim of fraud. 

These trends are bound to evolve over the years as influencer marketing continues to grow.
