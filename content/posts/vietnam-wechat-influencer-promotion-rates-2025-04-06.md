It seems like half the beauty brands in India are run by Vietnamese WeChat influencers. I‚Äôm not even joking.  

I was scrolling through a sponsored ad on Instagram, probably a Reels from some Aunty trying to sell me a cleansing balm, when I saw that the account claiming to promote this enchanted cosmetic was based in Ho Chi Minh City.  

Later, on another Aunty's account, I noticed one of her previous clients was a Vietnamese WeChat influencer, AND another Vietnamese WeChat influencer had sent her a DM trying to get her to promote their cleansing balm, and they were just talking about the same cleansing balm.  

This got me curious.  

 WhatsApp is almost an Indian second language now, and WeChat and WhatsApp use very much overlap. A lot of what is done on WhatsApp could be done on WeChat‚Äîbecause of this, I wanna know how Vietnamese influencers use WeChat to sell to Indian customers.  

So before I decide to get on Vietnamese WeChat influencer marketing trends, I want to get in on influencer marketing rates for that social media platform before it is too late.  

I hit up my buddy who runs a marketing consultancy specializing in Chinese social media, and this is what he told me.  

## üí∞ Vietnamese WeChat Influencers Charge High Prices  

Unlike Vietnamese influencers on TikTok or Facebook, Vietnamese WeChat influencers have trouble keeping their rates low.  

According to his experience, Vietnamese influencers charge twice the normal rate to promote on WeChat.  

They do this because WeChat is the only Chinese social media that requires a subscription to send messages.  

This means that every follower a WeChat influencer has is a paid follower; they‚Äôve put in time and money to get them.  

This gives WeChat influencers an advantage over their counterparts on platforms with freely-available followers.  

My buddy‚Äôs consultancy currently runs two websites that aggregate Vietnamese WeChat influencers, and the influencers on those sites charge from 20,000 INR to 200,000 INR per post.  

20,000 INR is on the low end of things, and is usually for someone with only a few subscribers who‚Äôs trying to grow their account.  

The highest prices are reserved for those with 100,000 subscribers or more.  

## üìù The Listings  

The most popular aggregator of Vietnamese WeChat influencers is Vietnam WeChat.  

Just looking through their listings, you can see how the pricing changes based on a few factors. First is the account type‚Äîwhether it is a personal or company account.  

Company accounts tend to cost more.  

Another important factor is whether the post is a photo or a video.  

A personal account video post costs about 25,000 INR, while a company account video post costs about 35,000 INR.  

At the high end, a personal account photo post costs about 125,000, while a company account photo post costs about 175,000 INR.  

A good middle-of-the-road option would be a personal account video post for 35,000, and this would be for an account with at least 10,000 followers.  

Here is a screenshot of the price listings.

## üì© Getting in Touch  

If you see Vietnamese WeChat influencer marketing as a viable option for your brand, you have to keep in mind that they will promote their WeChat handles.  

This means touching base with them first on WeChat.  

Getting a handle on Vietnamese WeChat influencer rates is only the first step in reaching out to them.  

Before doing that, be sure to have a WeChat account already created.  

Once you get someone‚Äôs WeChat handle, open the app and search for their handle under the ‚ÄòContacts‚Äô tab.  

After searching, you will be taken to a profile of the person whose WeChat handle you searched for.  

At this point, you can send a friend request.  

Alternatively, if you have the QR code of the WeChat account you wanna add, you can also scan that through the app.  

Once you‚Äôve added someone, you can message them right away.  

If they‚Äôre a Vietnamese WeChat influencer, they‚Äôll probably get back to you quickly.  

Keep in mind that some Vietnamese WeChat influencers are very strict about their work habits.  

If they say they will get back to you in 24 hours, they mean they will get back to you in 24 hours on the dot.  

If you don‚Äôt hear back from them after they said they would, it is most likely because you‚Äôve blown your chance to work with them by sending them 10 more messages demanding an answer.  

When they do get back to you, it‚Äôs best to use the ‚ÄòHi‚Äô message to greet them, and nothing more until they respond.  

This is just common courtesy in Vietnam.  

Another thing that is common courtesy is to make sure you‚Äôre paying something upfront.  

Many influencers, Vietnamese and otherwise, want half the payment up front.  

This is a fairly common practice for all kinds of social media influencers, but more and more influencers are refusing to do this due to getting scammed by brands that won‚Äôt send the second half of the money.  

Because Vietnamese WeChat influencers have a reputation of being especially trustworthy, they usually have no problem getting brands to pay something up front before they promote.  

Just make sure that you don‚Äôt try to scam them.  

Get a feel for their normal rates from the influencer aggregators, and pay half of what their normal rates are.  

This means if they want to charge you 100,000 INR to promote, you should pay them 50,000 INR up front.  

After the promotion, you can pay them the other 50,000 INR.  

## üîç How They Promote  

How a Vietnamese WeChat influencer promotes a brand depends on what the brand wants.  

Some brands want just a simple post of the influencer holding the product and looking cute while doing so.  

Others want the influencer to extoll the virtues of the product in a long winded text post.  

If you have any photos, videos or text you want the influencer to use, send that to them before they begin working on the promotion.  

This is also how you tell them what you want.  

If they send you back a draft, make sure to respond as quickly as possible with your feedback.  

Like I said earlier, they can take a long time before getting back to you if they think you‚Äôre holding up the process.  

Once the influencer is finished promoting, they will send you proof of the promotion.  

This can be a screenshot of the message thread, although it may take a couple of screenshots to capture everything they sent.  

They may also send you a recording of the entire conversation.  

## üîó Conclusion  

So if you are trying to sell directly to Indian buyers in 2025, think Vietnamese WeChat influencer marketing.  

Get your Vietnamese WeChat influencer marketing prices set in stone before you reach out to anyone, and you should be good to go.
