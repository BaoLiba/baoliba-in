Korean brunch influencers have begun trending in India, based on a 2023 study by the social media marketing company Zima Media. The study found that interest in Korean brunch influencers is projected to rise by 90% over the next five years as they create long-lasting digital footprints online. 

Zima Media's study focused on India‚Äôs population of 1.4 billion people and how they consume digital marketing online. The study also found that K-beauty influencers are also trending in India, with similar projections for their growth. 

‚ÄúCurrently, K-beauty influencers see an average of 79,500 searches per month in India. However, this number is projected to rise to 150,000 searches per month in 2028.

‚ùó Payments Made in Cryptocurrency Are Preferred  
India has yet to make cryptocurrency a legal tender, but that hasn‚Äôt stopped the use of virtual coins in various industries. Cryptocurrency is popular among the youth of India as financial markets become more unstable. 

In 2025, payments made in cryptocurrency will become the norm in India as cashless transactions will dominate the country‚Äôs economic landscape. According to an analysis done by BMC, cryptocurrency will record a CAGR of 50.8% in India, and 85% of Indian youth will prefer to make payments online in cryptocurrency. 

Influencer marketing agencies will champion the use of cryptocurrency payments for influencer collaborations as cashless transactions become mainstream. 

Crypto payments are already used by many influencer marketing agencies in India. For instance, 2023 saw Digital Marketing 101, a digital marketing agency based in India, announce that they would be using cryptocurrency payments in their influencer marketing campaigns. The agency made the announcement on their website. 

‚ÄúDigital Marketing 101 is proud to announce that we will now be sending payments to our influencers in cryptocurrency. The purpose of this move is to protect influencers from unstable currencies during these uncertain times. Furthermore, most influencers in India are millennials, who are more receptive to emerging technologies. Rather than wait for crypto payments to take hold in India, we‚Äôve decided to get ahead of the competition and begin now,‚Äù the agency stated. 

As more Indian influencer marketing agencies adopt the use of cryptocurrency for payments, they will also begin incorporating Korean brunch influencers into their marketing campaigns.
