When one thinks of Nepal, the first things that often come to mind are its mountains and ancient temples, but Nepal's social media influencer landscape is far more diverse and flourishing than one might guess.

Nepal is a rapidly emerging market for Indian influencers seeking brand deals on platforms like ShareChat. Many household names, especially from cities along India‚Äôs northern borders, are pulling in brand deals and contracts from Nepali companies that prefer to appeal to an Indian audience.

## üö© ShareChat: India‚Äôs Indie King

ShareChat is the largest homegrown social media platform in India, and its influencers boast a legion of followers that rivals their contemporaries on more ubiquitous platforms like Instagram and TikTok.

Indian influencers find themselves drawn to ShareChat‚Äôs regional content and vernacular feeds, which allow them to connect to a diverse audience across India‚Äôs many states and dialects. 

Despite ShareChat‚Äôs large user base, it is still relatively unexplored by brands. This means that Indian influencers have an opportunity to carve out a niche for themselves, especially when they expand their appeal into the neighboring country of Nepal.

## üìä Nepali Deals Are In Demand

Nepal is located just to the north of India, and many of its people have longstanding ties to their southern neighbor. 

Many Nepalis are able to converse in Hindi, especially those who live closer to the border, and it is not unusual to find Bollywood films and Indian television programs airing in the country‚Äôs urban areas.

Nepali consumers are also enthusiastic about products and services coming from India. This is in part due to the Indian Government‚Äôs many subsidy programs, such as providing various pieces of infrastructure.

Nepali companies have taken notice of Indian brands‚Äô popularity in their country, and they are now seeking similar results for themselves. 

This is where Indian ShareChat influencers come in. They are able to position themselves as authorities on Indian culture, and thus they hold insights into what Indian audiences might like to see from Nepali brands.

By leaning into this soft power, Indian ShareChat influencers have found unique ways to approach and fulfill brand deals with Nepali companies.

## üí∞ Cash Is Still King

While many Indian influencers are accustomed to receiving various kinds of products as payment for their work, many of ShareChat's prominent influencers make a point of securing cash payments instead.

The main reason for this is that many Nepali brands, especially those that are just starting to engage with influencers, do not yet understand what constitutes fair market value.

These brands might offer products or services worth several thousand rupees to an influencer, who then might respond by asking for cash payments worth only a fraction of that.

Indian ShareChat influencers are thus finding success in securing cash payments for their brand deals, which then allows them to leverage those relationships to negotiate for more favorable rates in the future.

## üíª The Points Payment Problem

While cash is still king, it should be noted that using other forms of payment is not without its own benefits. 

Nepali companies are often more comfortable negotiating brand deals that involve their own products or services, and this means that the overall price of a payment can be heavily inflated.

This has resulted in many influencers becoming more reliant on accepting points instead of cash payments, or forgoing a cash payment altogether.

A payment of 3000 rupees in kind might only cost a brand only about 700 rupees, and this then gives the brand more flexibility to pursue and negotiate multiple influencer contracts at once.

While points payments can work for well-established influencers who are in it for the long haul, newcomers should remain hesitant about adopting this strategy.

## ‚ùó Be Wary of Broker Services

Many Nepali brands are also brand new to influencer marketing, and they might seek out influencer marketing agencies to guide their efforts. 

Unfortunately, many influencer marketing agencies operating in Nepal are known to be rife with scams. They may not have the connections or access to brands that they claim to have, and they may also fail to deliver on their promises.

Indian ShareChat influencers should remember to take their time when vetting any such agencies. Influencer marketing is already a tricky business, and liaisoning with unreliable third parties will only muddle matters further.

## üîé Understand Your Target Audience

Fleshing out a brand deal is not the end of it for Indian ShareChat influencers. If they want to repeat their success, they have to be consistent with their brand messaging and image.

Many influencers are capable of doing this without breaking a sweat, but when it comes to Nepali brands, influencers should take precautions to get their messaging right.

Nepal‚Äôs culture is distinct from India‚Äôs, and while they may share similar influences and customs, they still have their own features that set them apart.

For example, the Nepali festival of Dashain is much bigger than its Indian counterpart of Durga Puja, and the similarities between the two celebrations are more than just skin deep.

Indian ShareChat influencers should take the time to familiarize themselves with the nuances of Nepali customs and culture. This will not only help them improve their messaging, but it will also help them gain the trust and respect of their colleagues in Nepal.
