How to Use Kwai for Business Marketing in India


üì¢ Kwai Overview


Kwai, or Kuaishou in China, is a rapidly growing social media app that is now one of China's main social media platforms, alongside Douyin (also dubbed TikTok in China).


Kwai is gaining traction worldwide with its easy-to-use format for sharing short-form videos.


While Kwai is not yet as globally recognized as TikTok, the social media app is rapidly expanding globally.


Kwai launched its business app in India, Koo, in 2023 to compete in India's growing social media market and is looking to position itself as a leading social media player in the nation.


According to estimates in 2022, Kwai has over 250 million monthly active users worldwide, with 300 million estimated active users in 2023.


Kwai reportedly closed a $3 billion investment round in August 2021 from Tencent, Baidu, Sequoia, and other top VCs.


Over 200 million of Kwai's monthly active users are from China alone.


Similar to TikTok, the app allows users to create short videos with audio effects and other editing features and has become popular in other countries, particularly in the Middle East, Brazil, and India.


The app is designed to be highly engaging and addictive, providing users with an endless scroll of entertaining content generated by other users.


Kwai employs algorithms that personalize content for each user based on their interests and behavior on the app.


The platform has a strong emphasis on community engagement and encourages users to interact with each other through comments, likes, and shares.


The app also features live streaming capabilities, allowing users to broadcast in real-time to their followers.


üí° Kuaishou Marketing in India


According to the latest market research and projections, India is estimated to have over 60 million users on Kwai (Koo) by 2025, making the app one of the top social media platforms.


Kwai is expected to continue to grow as it focuses on expanding its user-base in tier 2 and tier 3 cities in India, with the company predicting to reach 400 million users worldwide by 2025.


Marketers in India will need to optimize their social media marketing strategies on Kwai to take advantage of this rapid growth.


Kwai's user base mostly consists of Gen Z and Millennial users, making the app a vital platform for marketers to reach younger audiences.


It is estimated that 36% of Kwai users are under 24 years old, with 23% aged between 25-34 years old.


The average user on Kwai spends about 90 minutes daily on the app and opens the app about 10 times a day, spending about 20 minutes per session.


This places Kwai ahead of most social media apps in terms of user engagement.


Kwai is emerging as a serious competitor and alternative to TikTok, and as the growth of Kwai continues, marketers will need to adopt strategies that leverage the app for greater visibility and engagement.


‚ùó Why Focus On Kwai Marketing in India?


Kwai has made inroads into India since launching in the country. Kwai is focused on localizing its platform for the needs of Indian users.


Kwai has created a dedicated Indian version of its app, called Koo.¬†


The app has localized features that cater to Indian users and provide features that Indian users can identify with.


Koo also implements a ‚ÄúKoo certificate‚Äù badge that creators can earn for credibility. The Koo certification verifies the identity of creators (much like a blue badge on Twitter and Instagram).


Koo also allows creators to provide their own language preferences for their audience, including features that can translate posts into regional languages.


The Koo app is available in 12 Indian languages for users throughout the country.


Koo is a homegrown app that is made in India for Indians and is gaining traction among Indian users, attracting over 1 million creators.


Koo's CEO, and co-founder, Aprameya Radhakrishna, told the press that their team is engaged with Kwai, and the new platform will become an extension of Koo for more dynamic short video capabilities, including live streaming.


Koo has seen persistent growth over the past year. It had over 20 million active users monthly and saw 60 million downloads in 2021.


Koo has raised over $45 million in funding and has received investments from the Indian government itself, which seeks to promote and encourage Made in India apps as alternatives to foreign tech platforms.


Koo has also invested in establishing an Indian presence for the company, establishing regional offices in Bangalore, Mumbai, and Delhi.


Koo is on track to reach 100 million users in 2022 as Indian creators continue to flock to the app that is expected to go public later in 2021.


Koo has entered into a strategic partnership with the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to promote Koo as an alternative to Twitter for Indian users.


Koo is an alternative platform that allows Twitter users to continue to engage with their audience after Twitter imposed restrictions on Indian government officials.


Koo is on track to garner even more users, especially as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi began using the app.


Koo is an app that is gaining recognition. The platform has recently become one of Google's top rising apps and was nominated for the best startup of the year award.


üìä The Kwai App's Monetization Features


The Kwai app offers a host of monetization features that allow users to get paid for their content.¬†

These features allow creators to monetize their content without needing to rely on third-party apps or services to enable payments.


The Kwai app features include:


- **The Kwai Creators Program:** The Kwai Creatives program allows creators to earn rewards through likes, shares, and comments on the videos they post. Monetization starts at 100 likes, and creators can earn up to $20,000 a month.¬†

Qualifying creators can earn $0.01 to $1 and can even earn up to $12,000 a month. This kind of payment is made through the app, meaning Kwai has its payment processing capabilities integrated into the app itself.


- **Kwai Shop:** The Kwai Shop feature allows creators to sell merchandise through their profiles and videos. Creators can add links to their products, and followers can purchase items without navigating away from the app.¬†


- **Live Streaming Rewards:** Creators can earn gifts that can be converted to cash while live streaming on the platform. Viewers can send gifts to creators in the form of virtual coins. These coins can later be converted into cash.


- **Brand Partnerships:** Kwai offers various monetization programs that allow creators to collaborate with brands.  Brands can find creators through the Creator Marketplace. The marketplace allows brands to work with creators to promote their products or services through video content.


These monetization methods will attract many creators and influencers to the app.¬†


Traditional advertising methods such as banner ads and pay-per-click ads no longer generate the same effectiveness as they once did.


In-stream video ads are among the most engaging ad formats and have become a popular and effective advertising option.


Video content has become vital for marketers to get more exposure and visibility for their brands.


Kwai's monetization features will attract many creators and influencers who will seek to build followings on the app.


Influencer marketing coupled with short-form video ads is among the most effective marketing strategies available today.


Kwai's monetization features will entice many creators and influencers to join the platform and build large followings.


Marketers in India will need to adopt influencer marketing strategies that leverage Kwai's unique offering.
