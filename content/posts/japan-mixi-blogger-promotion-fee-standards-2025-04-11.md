Despite being most known for being the Japanese social media platform that has the most active user base of all time, Mixi is very different from how most popular social media platforms operate around the world. 


Mixi is also very casual, focusing on games.

Thus, Mixi influencers from Japan who are known from operating there are also different from influencers from other platforms, and thus also have different pricing standards.


This is something that foreign clients cannot fully grasp as it might be hard for them to get used to, especially when assuming how they want to collaborate with Japanese influencer marketing professionals within Mixi.

In this article, we'll analyze and explain how influencer marketing works on the Mixi platform, and how much Mixi influencers charge for their marketing services.

This will help foreign brands targeting Japan understand the Mixi influencer costs and budget for influencer marketing on that platform.


## üìä What Are Mixi Influencers?

Mixi influencers are not just influencers who happen to operate on Mixi, but rather they are Japanese influencers whose main platform that they primarily operate in is Mixi.

This is something that is hard to get used to as there are also influencer stars on major platforms who are also called Mixi influencers.

Though it is commonly said that Mixi influencers specifically refer to influencers who operate on Mixi, it is generally better to specify that to avoid confusion.

This shows that a lot of popular influencers also operate on Mixi - but whether they are popular in mainstream media or mainstream social media platforms, you can almost safely assume that their main focus they seem to have is on a different platform.

Thus, it is also safe to say that the majority of Mixi influencers are just popular Mixi influencers and not also influencers who operate on multiple platforms.


Another thing to note about Japanese influencers is that most work independently and even Mixi influencers have a reputation for working more independently than other influencers.

This is important to note, as it shows how Mixi influencers might have different pricing standards compared to influencers that are more commonly associated with agencies and management.

In general, influencer marketing professionals from Japan have a set of similarities compared to creators from other parts of the world, and they also have a lot of different differences from how they approach influencer marketing and how they set their pricing.


## ‚ö° Are Influencers on Mixi Expensive?

When it comes to influencer marketing and influencer pricing in Japan, everything really comes down to how experimental a brand actually wants to be.

Most mainstream marketing agencies have pricing standards that their clients and themselves can rely on so that everyone knows what to expect.

But that is not how Japanese creators from Mixi or even Japanese creators from other platforms operate.

Try to ask a Mixi influencer how much they charge, and they might say "How much do you want to pay me?".

It is safe to say that you will not get a straight answer about how much they charge and that is how the Japanese industry operates.

So when it comes to how much a Mixi influencer prices their marketing services, it is hard to say how much a typical influencer from Mixi charges. 


Though from recent analysis, including from 2025 onwards, it can be expected that the final cost of influencer marketing collaborations on Mixi may range from a minimum of ¬•1,000,000 (around $6,000) to a maximum of ¬•2,000,000 (around $12,000).

Influencer marketing collaborations on Mixi tend to fall anywhere in between that range depending on various factors.

When it comes to influencer marketing, if a client and influencer want a traditional marketing agency to set everything up for them, it may cost more - and this is also the case with Mixi influencer marketing.

So if looking to connect with a Mixi influencer directly, it is expected that it might cost a lot less than what it would if going through a marketing agency.

Though Japanese influencer marketing agencies that have a good reputation are known to be very direct and transparent, so if you happen to know a good agency, it might be worth going through them instead of trying to connect with a Mixi influencer directly.


## ü§ú What Factors Influence The Costs of Collaborating with Mixi Influencers?

While the final cost of influencer marketing collaborations on Mixi will depend on many factors, there are three main factors that every influencer marketing professional will consider in whatever pricing standard they use.

If you are working directly with a Mixi influencer, you might be expected to just cover these costs and not have to deal with an influencer marketing agency.

It's also important to note that Mixi influencer marketing rates can change depending on the current trending situations.

So if you're looking to engage a Mixi influencer in 2025, here are the 3 main factors that will affect how much they might charge for their services:


### 1. üéØ The Type of Marketing Collaboration

Influencer marketing on Mixi can happen in many different ways, and this is one of the biggest reasons why pricing can differ between marketing collaborations.

The main types of influencer marketing collaborations on Mixi are:

- Sponsored Posts
- Affiliate Marketing Programs
- Product Reviews
- Social Media Contests
- Giveaways
- Brand Ambassador Programs
- Hosting Events

Depending on the type, the pricing could be lower or higher. For example, if running a giveaway, a Mixi influencer might ask for the giveaway prize to be covered. 

But overall, the industry standard is that if the marketing collaboration takes more effort for the influencer or requires them to take more responsibility, then you can expect to pay more for that service.

### 2. üîë The Responsibilities of The Influencer

When it comes down to it, Mixi influencers are still independent creatives and they can choose how much responsibility they want to take when collaborating with a brand.

For example, if a brand wants a Mixi influencer to simply post what they give them, that influencer might only charge for the post itself and nothing more.

But if the influencer has to create their own content and make it fit the brand's messaging and they also have to submit drafts for approval, then expect that a lot more will be charged for that collaboration.

Depending on how much responsibility a brand wants to give a Mixi influencer will also heavily influence how much the influencer will charge.

### 3. üí° The Brand being Promoted

Just like how the type of marketing collaboration influences the pricing, so does the brand that is being promoted.

Some brands are just more expensive to promote than others and this is also true for influencer marketing on Mixi.

For example, most luxury brands are and should be more expensive to promote, and thus Mixi influencers promoting them will also charge more than the industry standard.

If a brand has a reputation for being unreliable or shady, then that will negatively impact how much a Mixi influencer will charge for their services.

Overall, a reputable brand can expect to pay more for a Mixi influencer's services compared to a brand that is not very reputable or has a bad reputation.

It's also worth noting that Japanese influencers are still independent creatives, even if they are popular or have a lot of followers.

Thus, it is very important to respect their decisions and how they choose to run their careers, and how much they choose to charge. 

Understanding these three main factors can help a brand budget how much they want to spend on influencer marketing and how they want to plan their campaigns ahead of time.


## ü§ù How To Collaborate With a Mixi Influencer?

When it comes to collaborating with a Mixi influencer, it's also important to understand and be familiar with how things operate when engaging with a Japanese influencer.

Although it is possible to directly reach out to a Mixi influencer and collaborate with them, using an influencer marketing platform such as BaoLiba can save you a lot of time and effort.

Platforms like BaoLiba connect brands directly with influencers, and they do all of the hard work for you - including ensuring payment and working out the details of the collaboration.

While it is possible to reach out to a Mixi influencer directly, if they are popular, they may receive lots of messages from brands wanting to collaborate with them. 

So if you can even reach out to them, there is no guarantee that they will even respond to you.

This is why it is encouraged to use an influencer marketing platform to save you the hassle of finding and contacting Mixi influencers that are relevant to your brand. 

Here are three easy steps you can take to engage a Mixi influencer using BaoLiba:

- Sign up for a free account.

Using BaoLiba can save you a lot of hassle and help you get the most out of your influencer marketing campaigns.

So even if planning to reach out to Mixi influencers directly, it is still good to register for an account to help you find influencers that connect with your brand.


## üìå Conclusion

In conclusion, influencer marketing on Mixi has so much potential, and that is why it is so important to keep in mind everything we discussed.

Mixi influencers have their own pricing standards and even vary from one influencer to another, but it is slightly more consistent than other platforms.

However, it ultimately comes down to how much a brand is willing to spend. 

If all three factors take a lot of effort, or the brand is one that is reputable and has a good reputation, then a Mixi influencer may charge more for their services.

If a brand is not reputable, or requires more effort from a Mixi influencer to promote their brand, then they should expect to pay less.

A general price range for influencer marketing collaborations on Mixi can also be expected from around ¬•1,000,000 (around $6,000) to ¬•2,000,000 (around $12,000).

The best way to ensure you can connect with your ideal Mixi influencer is to use an influencer marketing platform such as BaoLiba, as they can help your brand find relevant influencers and save you valuable time.
