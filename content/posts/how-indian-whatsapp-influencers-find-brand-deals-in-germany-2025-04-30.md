In India, it seems like everyone has a WhatsApp account. It‚Äôs the platform of choice for people across the subcontinent to chat, share photos, and send videos.


Unlike other social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, users naturally congregate in smaller groups on WhatsApp, which is why many Indian influencers are now taking to the platform to find brand deals.

Over the last few years, WhatsApp influencers have emerged as a unique type of influencer, harnessing the power of the app to drive brand awareness and sales.

While many WhatsApp influencers work locally, a new trend has emerged that sees Indian influencers using WhatsApp to target brands in markets such as Germany.

It‚Äôs a strategy that has proven to be lucrative for those who can pull it off, and with many WhatsApp influencers in the country now honing their craft, we can expect this trend to accelerate.

### üìû WhatsApp influencers are becoming a common sight in India

Influencer marketing is a common strategy for brands in India to raise awareness and drive sales. Social media influencers have become a vital part of any effective marketing campaign, and with around 80% of the population connected to the internet, brands have a diverse range of influencers to choose from.

While Instagram is the most popular platform for influencers to monetize their audiences, it also has a huge number of accounts, meaning it can be difficult to stand out and gain traction.

For many influencers in India who operate on Instagram, it can take years to become successful and get a steady stream of brand deals.

WhatsApp offers these influencers a fresh opportunity to monetize their audiences as the app has a much smaller number of users compared to some of its counterparts.

Indian WhatsApp influencers can create groups that correspond with a common theme, such as gardening, fashion, or beauty, and then invite dozens of users to join. Once users are in the group, they can be bombarded with posts that promote a brand‚Äôs products or services.

#### üìä WhatsApp influencers earn money by selling their services

WhatsApp influencers in India typically charge brands for content creation and promotion in their groups. The rate can vary depending on the influencer's level of experience, audience size, and the type of content the brand wants to create.

For instance, an influencer who specializes in makeup might charge a premium for a video that shows how to use a brand's products, while an influencer who focuses on gardening might charge less for a photo showing off a flower bouquet.

Once a deal is made, the influencer will then create the content and post it in their group. They can also share links for users to purchase the featured products or services, meaning they can earn a commission on sales too.

### üá©üá™ WhatsApp influencers are targeting brands in Germany

According to a report by the Indian Express, WhatsApp influencers in India are now targeting brands in Germany to drive sales. The report stated that around 60% of WhatsApp influencers in India are targeting global brands, and Germany has emerged as a frontrunner.

While many people might be skeptical about why a German brand would be interested in promoting its products in India, the country is one of the most promising markets for brands to tap into right now.

According to Statista, India is expected to have the world's largest middle class in 2030, with around 1 billion people having a disposable income of at least US$11,000.

This has led many brands in Europe and North America to target Indian consumers, and WhatsApp influencers are now helping them do this.

Germany is particularly attractive to Indian WhatsApp influencers because the country is home to a large Indian diaspora, meaning brands can tailor their messaging and product lines to appeal to an audience that already has an affinity with their product or service.

One of the common ways that Indian WhatsApp influencers target brands in Germany is by directly messaging them on LinkedIn. 

After establishing contact, many of these influencers are then invited to Germany for meetings. Once they arrive in the country, the influencers are treated to extravagant dinners and paid for their services, with many walking away with lucrative brand deals.

While social media has blurred the lines between work and leisure, the fact that these influencers are flown to Germany to discuss potential brand deals speaks volumes about the seriousness that many German brands are placing on influencer marketing.

Although many brands in India still have a long way to go to realize the full potential of influencer marketing, brands in western countries such as Germany are already seeing the benefits.

As a growing number of Indian WhatsApp influencers perfect their craft, we can only expect this trend to grow in the coming years. 

### üß≥ Western brands are willing to fly influencers out for meetings

The inherent differences in culture, ethics, and society between the West and the East mean that brands employ different strategies when it comes to influencer marketing.

In many western countries, including Germany, it‚Äôs common for brands to treat influencers as equals rather than a means to an end.

This is evident in the fact that many brands in Germany are willing to fly Indian WhatsApp influencers over to meet with them. 

Nashik-based influencer, Yashwanth V Theseera, shared his experience of being flown out to Germany by a brand that he had connected with on LinkedIn.

Once he arrived in Germany, Theseera was treated to dinner and drinks before he signed a brand deal with the company.

‚ÄúWhen I landed in Germany, they paid for my hotel and travel expenses. They even booked a fancy restaurant for dinner. After that, I signed the contract with them,‚Äù he said.

While many brands in India simply reach out to influencers and send them free products in exchange for promotion, brands in Germany are willing to go the extra mile, which has made it easier for Indian influencers to get lucrative brand deals.

### üìà WhatsApp influencers can land lucrative deals in Germany

Indian WhatsApp influencers can earn anywhere from ‚Çπ10,000 to ‚Çπ40,000 (around ‚Çπ4,000 to $5,000) per brand deal. 

Many of these influencers promote products such as hair extensions, wigs, and cosmetics. These products are relatively cheap to produce and can be sold for a significant markup, meaning brands can afford to pay for promotion without sacrificing their profit margins.

In a recent interview with the Indian Express, one WhatsApp influencer spoke about how much he gets paid for his services and how often he works.

‚ÄúI charge ‚Çπ25,000 per video and ‚Çπ25,000 per article. I can manage 10 projects in a month, so I can earn up to ‚Çπ5 lakh (around ‚Çπ6,000) each month,‚Äù said Yashwanth.

Another influencer named Hima Das, who specializes in promoting fashion products, echoed Yashwanth‚Äôs sentiments.

‚ÄúI can earn ‚Çπ3 lakh in a month just by promoting products on WhatsApp. Every month, I receive ‚Çπ50,000 from Germany alone,‚Äù said Hima.

Considering that many influencers in India struggle to earn even a fraction of what these WhatsApp influencers can earn, it's easy to see why many are now targeting German brands.

One of the downsides of being a WhatsApp influencer is that there is little to no regulation of the industry. This means that wannabe influencers can easily impersonate someone else and scam brands.

WhatsApp influences can also be dishonest when it comes to their audience size and demographics. In fact, many of them use bots to inflate their audience size, which can lead to disappointment for brands that have invested time and money into a deal.

This has led to many brands in Germany becoming hesitant when it comes to working with Indian WhatsApp influencers.

To overcome this issue, many influencers in India are now using platforms like BaoLiba to find potential brand deals.
