It‚Äôs no secret that Indian YouTube influencers have recently taken the plunge into the Netherlands. 

The influx of these Indian influencers has, in fact, reached such a level that prominent Dutch brands have started changing their influencer marketing strategies to woo them back home. 

Whether it is Indian YouTube influencers like Mohak Narula or Rashmeet Kaur, who is actually a singer, are they really coming back home after their successful stints in the Netherlands, who knows?

Do they even want to come back? Do they even have to?

Let‚Äôs take a look at how Indian YouTube influencers are marching into the Netherlands and landing brand deals like it‚Äôs their home ground.


## üí° The Dutch influencer marketing scene is ideal for Indian YouTubers

The Netherlands is home to some of the top social media influencers in Europe. 

According to the 2023 Influencer Marketing Benchmark Report, 38% of marketers from the Netherlands reported that they were utilizing influencer marketing in their brands. 

That‚Äôs a whopping increase of 13% since 2021, when only 25% of marketers reported using influencer marketing for their brands. 

The report also states that 44% of marketers from the Netherlands plan on increasing their influencer marketing budgets in 2023, an increase of 20% from 2021. 

Even though the country is home to digitally-savvy marketers, only 46% of marketers think their current influencer marketing is effective.


## ü§ù Dutch brands are turning to Indian YouTubers

Despite the competitive Dutch influencer marketing landscape, brands from the Netherlands have started collaborating with Indian YouTube influencers to reach their fellow citizens. 

Indian YouTubers have been coming to the Netherlands for months now, creating content that resonates with the Indian diaspora in the Netherlands, as well as the Dutch locals.

The key to their success rests on the fact that Indian YouTubers have always had a strong diaspora audience in the Netherlands. 

For instance, Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan has almost 1 million followers on Instagram from the Netherlands, which represents 4% of his total followers. 

Likewise, other Bollywood celebrities like Shah Rukh Khan and Priyanka Chopra also have considerable followership from the Netherlands. 

So, it comes as no surprise that Dutch brands have begun collaborating with Indian YouTube influencers to reach the Indian diaspora, as well as locals from the Netherlands. 


## üá≥üá± Dutch marketers are reaching out to Indian YouTubers

The fact that Indian YouTube influencers are landing brand deals in the Netherlands means that brands in the country are actively reaching out to these Indian influencers. 

In fact, a report by the Influencer Marketing Agency states that 22% of brands in the Netherlands are planning to reach out to influencers in new markets like India.

This is a significant trend, considering that this is only the beginning. 

If we take a look at the statistics of the Influencer Marketing Benchmark Report again, we see that 58% of marketers in the Netherlands are still using Instagram as their primary platform. 

Only 25% consider YouTube as a key channel, which is surprising for the country that brought YouTube stars like Nikkie Tutorials and Enzo Knol. 

However, it is also good news for Indian YouTube influencers because it leaves a lot of room for growth in influencer marketing for them in the Netherlands. 

With both brands and marketers having a hunch that YouTube is going to become a much bigger player in the influencer marketing arena, Indian YouTube influencers have a chance to dominate. 


## üéâ Indian YouTubers are taking over events in the Netherlands

There are also some Indian YouTubers who have been invited to major events in the Netherlands. 

For instance, Bhavin Bhanushali, a popular Indian YouTuber, was invited to the G-Star Gaming Expo in the Netherlands. 

At the expo, Bhavin met and chatted with other popular gamers and YouTube influencers, as well as fellow Indian YouTuber Kiran Dembla. 

Bhavin said that he had a great time at the event and thanked the event organizers for inviting him and Kiran. 


## üí∞ Indian YouTubers are getting paid in Euros for their brand deals

Now that we have established that Dutch brands are reaching out to Indian YouTubers for brand deals, let‚Äôs take look at how Indian YouTubers are getting paid for these influencer marketing campaigns. 

With the rise of Indian YouTubers in the Netherlands, many Indian YouTubers are also landing brand deals with Dutch brands. 

In fact, they‚Äôre getting paid in Euros, which is a big deal in India. 

For instance, Indian YouTuber Sandeep Maheshwari has collaborated with Dutch energy drink brand Raptor. 

Sandeep confirmed in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that he would be collaborating with the Dutch brand and getting paid in Euros. 

He said, ‚ÄúI am getting paid in Euros for this collaboration. 

And the best thing is that I don‚Äôt have to show my face. I can just drink the energy drink in my car and that‚Äôs it.‚Äù 


## üíµ How much are Indian YouTubers getting paid for brand deals in the Netherlands?

While we don‚Äôt know how much Indian YouTubers are getting paid for brand deals in the Netherlands, we do know that Dutch brands are offering them money in Euros instead of Rupees. 

For instance, Indian YouTuber Mohak Narula shared a video where he said that he got paid 200 Euros for advertising a laundry detergent on his YouTube channel. 

In that same video, Mohak also revealed that he had been offered 800 Euros to participate in a music video featuring a local Dutch singer. 

That comes out to be about 17,000 Rupees in Indian currency. 

If we take a look at the average rates for influencer marketing in India, we see that they are considerably low for brands from the Netherlands to even think of collaborating with Indian YouTubers. 


## üìä Dutch agencies are collaborating with Indian YouTubers

A lot of Indian YouTubers who are landing brand deals in the Netherlands are collaborating with local agencies in the Netherlands. 

These agencies are connecting them with brands in the Netherlands. 

For instance, Mohak Narula, who we mentioned earlier, recently shared a video where he revealed that he had been booked for a tour in the Netherlands.

The tour was organized by the Dutch agency Glocal. 

The agency specializes in promoting Indian artists abroad and bringing international artists to India. 

They had booked Mohak for a week-long tour in the Netherlands, where he is going to perform at various cities in the country. 

The first city in the Netherlands where he is going to perform is Amsterdam on November 18, 2023, followed by Rotterdam, The Hague, and Eindhoven. 


## ‚ùó Indian YouTubers are not the only ones landing brand deals in the Netherlands

While Indian YouTubers are landing brand deals in the Netherlands, they are not the only ones doing that. 

In fact, Dutch brands have even started collaborating with Indian influencers from platforms like TikTok. 

For instance, Dutch influencer marketing agency INFLUENCER.AGENCY recently collaborated with Indian TikTok influencer Piyush Bhagat. 

Piyush has over 10 million followers on TikTok and specializes in dance videos. 

The collaboration was for a local Dutch radio station that wanted to reach the Indian diaspora in the Netherlands. 

Piyush visited various cities in the country, promoting the radio station, and got paid in Euros for it. 


## üè¶ Indian YouTubers can open bank accounts in the Netherlands

Another reason why Indian YouTubers are successfully landing brand deals in the Netherlands is that they can open bank accounts in the Netherlands. 

This allows Indian YouTubers to receive payments in Euros directly without any hassle. 

For those YouTubers who are not able to do that, there are other payment methods available for them to receive payments in Euros. 

For instance, Mohak Narula revealed in a video that he can receive payment in Euros via Wise, a money transfer service. 

Wise allows users to send and receive money online in 55 currencies, including Euros. 

With regards to opening a bank account in the Netherlands, there are two requirements that Indian YouTubers need to fulfill. 

First, they need to have a residence permit for the Netherlands. 

Second, they need to have a BSN number, which is a Dutch citizen service number that they can apply for once they get their residence permit. 

The BSN number allows Indian YouTubers to get a bank account and various other services in the Netherlands. 


## üì± How Indian YouTube influencers can land brand deals in Netherlands

We have seen how Indian influencers are landing brand deals in the Netherlands, but how can Indian YouTube influencers land these brand deals themselves?

Well, here are a few tips for Indian YouTube influencers who want to land brand deals in the Netherlands. 

First, they need to build a strong presence on social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. 

They should create content that resonates with the Dutch audience and showcases their personality and skills. 

Next, they should reach out to Dutch brands directly and pitch their ideas for collaborations. 

This can be done through email or social media DMs. 

Indian YouTube influencers can also collaborate with local agencies that specialize in influencer marketing, as we saw in the case of Mohak Narula. 

They should also leverage their existing network and connections in the industry to find potential brand deals. 

Finally, they should be professional and reliable in their dealings with brands and agencies to build a good reputation and secure repeat collaborations.
