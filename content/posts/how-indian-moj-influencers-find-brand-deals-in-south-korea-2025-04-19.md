The Indian influencer marketing scene is changing, as a recent MOJ influencer brand deal debacle in South Korea shows. What does this mean for brands and influencers in India?

MOJ influencers are preferred by prominent brands across India, as shown in a viral video where three Indian MOJ influencers were recently deported from South Korea for filming a brand promotion at a hotel without a visa.

Many social media observers from India believe that the deportation puts a question mark on the MOJ influencer marketing scene back home in India.

#### üìΩÔ∏è **MOJ Influencer Brand Deals: The South Korean Debacle**

Three Indian influencers have been kicked out of South Korea after they filmed a promotional video for the Indian short video platform MOJ in a hotel without a visa. The influencers were identified as Bhuvan Bam, Sameer Mark and Vishal Pandey.

In the viral video, Bhuvan Bam who is also a popular YouTuber, expressed that he felt like a criminal when the authorities found out they didn‚Äôt have the right visa to film in South Korea.

Bhuvan Bam and his associates reportedly arrived in South Korea under a tourist visa, which doesn‚Äôt allow foreign nationals to film or create content for profit. After being caught, they were questioned by police and escorted to the airport for a departure flight.

Bhuvan Bam‚Äôs MOJ influencer brand deal fiasco is a stark reminder to other influencers in India that they should be wary of brand collaborations that could potentially involve legal issues.

#### ü§ë **Why Indian Brands Use MOJ Influencers?**

MOJ influencers are in high demand when it comes to influencer marketing in India. A recent report from the Indian influencer marketing agency, The Good Creator Co., highlighted that 27% of Indian brands have worked with MOJ influencers in 2022.

The report revealed that 39% of influencers in India are using MOJ as their creative platform. The explosion of MOJ influencers has been attributed to their creativity, with 52% of followers viewing them as more relatable than other influencers.

The popularity of Indian MOJ influencers can be partly attributed to the fact that many of them upload content that is comedic in nature, which naturally draws viewers‚Äô attention. This is especially true among Indian teenagers, who make up over 70% of MOJ users.

The popularity of MOJ influencers in India stands in stark contrast to their South Korean counterparts, with Indian influencers getting paid an average of $194 per post. South Korean influencers command ten times that amount, earning an average of $1,845 per post.

As a result, many Indian influencers are heading to South Korea to work with brands on influencer marketing campaigns. They see invites to Korea as a chance for them to increase their visibility and command higher fees for brand deals back home in India.

Unfortunately for MOJ influencers, the South Korean immigration authorities have become increasingly aware of illegal filming in the country. This has led to a crackdown on foreign influencers who don‚Äôt have the proper visas.

Various brands in South Korea leverage the fame of these influencers and often help them with visa applications so that they can create content for the brands they‚Äôre promoting. The problem arises when Indian influencers arrive in South Korea uninvited and try to work on brand deals.

#### ‚ùó **What MOJ Influencers Should Know About Korean Brand Deals?**

While their South Korean counterparts often have the backing of brands in South Korea, many Indian MOJ influencers trespass by arriving in the country without permission.

When Korean authorities discover that these influences have appeared on their doorstep, the authorities often kick them out of the country. Therefore, it is important for Indian influencers to be wary of MOJ influencer brand deals that involve traveling to South Korea.

MOJ influencers should also be cautious of brand deals that require them to go incognito at Korean airports, as was the case with Indian travel influencer Arjun Kakkar.

Arjun Kakkar is one of many Indian influencers who have taken it upon themselves to cause a stir at Korean airports in order to gain followers and fame at home in India.

While some Indian influencers have received invitations to South Korea‚Äôs bustling airport, Incheon International Airport, not all of them have. This has resulted in some influencers being sent back home by South Korean authorities.

#### ü§≥ **Indian MOJ Influencers Trying to Enter South Korea Alone?**

In a recent video, Arjun Kakkar was reportedly forced to leave South Korea after authorities discovered that he had entered the country on a tourist visa. He was caught in the act of filming a visa-free entry video at the airport.

Arjun Kakkar claimed that he was barred from shooting a promotional film for a brand because he didn‚Äôt have the right visa. Subsequently, he was escorted to the airport by South Korean officials and sent back home to India.

The financial pressures to go viral and earn a MOJ brand deal can push influencers into dangerous territory. A recent study published in the UK‚Äôs Journal of Social Psychology found that some influencers are willing to break the law just to gain followers. 

It is clear that some Indian influencers are unaware of the laws in other countries, particularly those in South Korea. This is unfortunate given that the South Korean government has made it clear that they‚Äôre not interested in influencers who don‚Äôt follow the rules, regulations and laws of the country.

In a recent press release, the South Korean government stated that they are aware of the ‚Äúflood of illegal influencers at major tourist sites and airports across the country‚Äù. They reiterated that ‚Äúforeigners who enter the country for tourism purposes are prohibited from conducting any profitable activities‚Äù. 

#### üõÇ **MOJ Influencers Need Work Permits to Make Money in Korea**

To make money as a foreign influencer in South Korea, you need a C-1-2 visa. The visa allows foreign nationals to engage in short-term work or activities while residing in South Korea. 

Such activities can include attending events or exhibitions, covering and conducting interviews for media, filming documentaries, and performing artistic work.  Also, you cannot apply for the C-1-2 visa on your own, as it requires a letter of invitation from a company or organization in South Korea.

Therefore, if you are an Indian MOJ influencer looking to work in South Korea, you need to establish a relationship with a local agency that specializes in influencer marketing. The agency will help you obtain a C-1-2 visa before you leave India.

It is also important to check in advance whether the visa can be extended if necessary and how many times it can be renewed. 

#### üö® **Illegal MOJ Influencers Get Kicked Out of Korea**

Illegal influencers in South Korea can be slapped with fines and jail time, as well as and deportation or a ban from re-entering the country.

In January 2023, the South Korean government vowed to crack down on illegal influencers that don‚Äôt follow the rules. The promises came after a string of complaints from both locals and legitimate influencers regarding illegal influencers causing disruptions in public places.

The South Korean government began appealing to legitimate influencers to report those that are in the country illegally. The Seoul government also promised to cooperate with South Korea‚Äôs National Police Agency to apprehend illegal influencers. 

The crackdown has been growing over the past year, with illegal influencers in South Korea being reported dating back to October 2022. A manager at Incheon International Airport stated during the time that they were ‚Äúoverrun‚Äù with illegal influencers.

Authorities estimated that some 700 illegal influencers entered South Korea between January and September of 2022. Most of them reportedly entered the country on tourist visas and overstayed.
