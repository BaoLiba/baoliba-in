The UK is home to over 1.8 million Indians, making it the largest ethnic minority in the country. It's no surprise that Indian businesses are pouring into the UK to promote their products and services to the growing Indian diaspora.

Despite the many cultural barriers, Indian entrepreneurs are adapting their marketing strategies and reaching out to Indian influencer talent.


## ü§≥ Indians are finding influencer talent within India

Moj is India's leading short-video platform, and Indian entrepreneurs with interests in the UK are tapping into Moj talent to promote their brand.

The platform has a wide array of talent from various domains, including comedy, dance, and lifestyle content. When combined with the Indian community in the UK, Moj influencers are a perfect fit.

Anuj Sood is a dental entrepreneur based in London who reached out to Indian influencers on Moj after discovering them while on holiday back home in India last summer.

"I went to a wedding in Punjab and saw a bunch of influencers on Moj create wedding content. I thought it was hilarious and a great way to promote products.

I didn't have much time to do my research, so I just found influencers through the Moj app. I sent them a message and they responded quickly, especially when money was mentioned," said Anuj.


## üí∏ Payments are made easier with UPI

The ease of making payments via UPI is a major draw for Indian influencers based in India looking for brand deals with Indian businesses in the UK.

UPI payments are instant and can be made at little to no cost. They can also be made from across the world without the hassle of dealing with currency exchanges and bank fees.

Anuj Sood uses a third-party platform called BaoLiba to purchase Moj influencer marketing packages.

"Platforms like BaoLiba handle everything for you, including negotiations, influencer selection, payments, and reporting.

I just set a budget, share my requirements, and BaoLiba does the rest. Best of all, I can pay via UPI. This means I can be in the UK and pay influencers in India without any hassle," added Anuj.


## üì± Moj influencers are becoming more active in the UK

Indian influencer talent on Moj is becoming more active in the UK. Specifically, during major Indian celebrations, such as Diwali and Holi.

UK-based Indian entrepreneurs are reaching out to Moj influencers as they know that they have access to authentic Indian talent.

Moj influencers are now also targeting Indian communities in the UK to score more brand deals. They do this by creating content that depicts their travels to the UK and engaging directly with the Indian community online.

"This year I went to London for Diwali and created various content pieces that showed how Diwali is celebrated in the UK compared to India. I even did a live Q&A with my followers about my experiences. It was a hit.

I had so many brand deals from Indian businesses because of that trip, as well as offers to travel to the UK more often," said Shivangi Sharma, a Moj influencer from Delhi.

Shivangi's success reflects the growing trend of Indian businesses using Moj influencers to reach Indian audiences in the UK.
