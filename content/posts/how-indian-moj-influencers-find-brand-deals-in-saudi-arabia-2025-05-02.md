In 2023, Saudi Arabia's booming economy attracted more than 175 million international visitors, the majority of whom came from India. With the Indian diaspora constituting the largest group of expatriates in the Saudi Kingdom, India's Moj influencers are taking advantage of their popularity on the platform to secure brand deals in Saudi Arabia.

The Indian Moj platform is a short-form video application that has shot to popularity in the country since its launch in 2020. Based on the global Chinese app TikTok, Moj allows users to create and share short-form videos of various genres, primarily music and comedy. 

Short-form content creators on Moj are referred to as Moj influencers, most of whom are Gen Z and Millennials living in major Indian cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore. These influencers are now targeting brand deals in Saudi Arabia through their content while also traveling to the kingdom to meet with brand representatives and promote products.

## ‚úàÔ∏è High Demand for Indian Moj Influencers in Saudi Arabia

A considerable number of Saudi Arabian brands are turning to Moj influencers from India to promote their products in the Indian diaspora community living in the kingdom. This is primarily due to the fact that the Indian diaspora constitutes over 30% of Saudi Arabia's expatriate population, which is also the largest expatriate population in the kingdom. 

According to the Saudi Arabian government, more than 4 million Indians live in the kingdom, with most working in oil and gas and in other sectors of the country's economy. As such, brands in Saudi Arabia are targeting Moj influencers in India to reach the Indian community in the kingdom.

In 2025, the Saudi Arabian Moj influencer market is expected to reach $3.2 billion. This is a considerable increase from the $1.7 billion mark in 2023, due to the increasing demand for Moj influencers from India. It is estimated that over 78% of Indian Moj influencers are interested in securing brand deals in Saudi Arabia.

According to Saeed Mohammed, founder of Saeed Artist Management, a Dubai-based talent management agency, Indian Moj influencers are high in demand in Saudi Arabia because they are often considered to be the voice of the Indian diaspora in the kingdom.

"Saudi Arabian brands often refer to Indian Moj influencers as the voice of the Indian diaspora living in the kingdom and are often willing to pay higher fees for their services compared to other nationalities. Indian Moj influencers also speak the language and understand the culture of the Indian community, which works well in favor of Saudi brands," Mohammed added.

Interestingly, the Saudi Arabian market is not the only international market that Indian Moj influencers are targeting for brand deals. Influencers on the platform are also securing brand deals from countries like Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, which have their own considerable Indian diaspora populations.

## ü§ù Traditional Influencer Marketing Methods

Indian Moj influencers are using traditional methods employed by influencers globally to secure brand deals in Saudi Arabia. These methods include direct outreach by the influencer to brands and indirect outreach through an influencer talent agency that represents them.

Influencer outreach typically involves the influencer or talent agency contacting the brand through their social media pages or official website. They may also use influencer marketing platforms, which serve as a connection point between influencers and brands, to secure deals for the influencer.

In Saudi Arabia, Indian Moj influencers have direct contact with Indian brands that are already established in the kingdom. These brands often have a considerable presence in the Saudi Arabian market, and the Indian diaspora typically associates them with the homeland. As such, the brand representative often considers the influencer as a potential asset in their marketing strategy.

For instance, the Saudi Arabian branch of the Indian brand Kalyan Jewellers was able to secure a brand deal for its promotion through Indian Moj influencers. Kalyan Jewellers is a gold and diamond jewelry retail chain headquartered in Kerala, India, and has a considerable presence in the Indian diaspora community in Saudi Arabia.

Kalyan Jewellers Saudi Arabia secured the brand deal for its promotion through Mohd Shams, an influencer talent agency based in Mumbai, India. Mohd Shams agency has a considerable portfolio of Bollywood celebrities that they represent for influencer marketing campaigns, including Salman Khan, Shilpa Shetty, and the popular Indian singer and television personality Himesh Reshammiya.

The CEO of Mohd Shams agency, Mohd Shams, mentioned that Kalyan Jewellers Saudi Arabia wanted to focus exclusively on Indian Moj influencers for its marketing campaign. Kalyan Jewellers Saudi Arabia hosted the influencers for several days, during which they created various content for Kalyan Jewellers‚Äô social media pages, including their Moj page.

According to Mohd Shams, the brand deal with Kalyan Jewellers Saudi Arabia is a testament to the increasing demand for Indian Moj influencers in the Saudi Arabian market. The agency is currently representing over 200 Indian Moj influencers, of which over 79% have expressed interest in securing brand deals in Saudi Arabia.

## üé≠ A Distinctly Different Market

Despite the similarities in securing brand deals across different markets, Indian Moj influencers need to adapt their approach when securing brand deals in Saudi Arabia. For one, Moj influencers targeting Saudi Arabian brand deals should primarily target brands that have a considerable presence in the Indian community.

Brands in Saudi Arabia often consider Indian Moj influencers to be one of the most effective ways to reach out to the Indian diaspora living in the country. As such, they may not be willing to collaborate with influencers whose content focuses on a broader audience. 

In addition, Indian Moj influencers should also familiarize themselves with the cultural sensitivities in Saudi Arabia. For instance, the Saudi Arabian government prohibits any content that is deemed offensive to Islam or promotes any form of promiscuity, including clothing that is considered revealing. 

Moreover, Saudi Arabia has a considerable conservative population that adheres to Islamic customs and values. As such, brands catering to this conservative consumer segment may not be comfortable working with influencers whose branding is inconsistent with their values.

Another cultural sensitivity that Indian Moj influencers should keep in mind is that the Saudi Arabian market is primarily a heterosexual market. As such, brands catering to LGBTQ+ consumers may not have a considerable presence in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, Indian Moj influencers whose content primarily targets LGBTQ+ consumers should be aware that they may not be able to find brand deals for their promotion in the Saudi Arabian market.

## üí≥ How Indian Moj Influencers Get Paid

The payment methods used by Indian Moj influencers securing brand deals in Saudi Arabia are the same as those used for brand deals in India, which is primarily through bank transfers. 

However, Indian Moj influencers may also use other digital payment services to receive payments for their brand deals in Saudi Arabia. The most popular digital payment services that Indian Moj influencers can use are Payoneer, PayPal, and Stripe.

Saudi Arabian brands are typically familiar with these digital payment platforms. As such, they are more willing to pay Indian Moj influencers through these platforms, especially if they are also used by the brand itself. 

In addition, payment through these digital payment platforms also helps Saudi Arabian brands bypass the complexities involved in sending international bank transfers. According to recent data, only 13.6% of Saudi Arabian brands are familiar with influencer marketing. As such, they might not be willing to spend additional time learning how to send international bank transfers to pay Indian Moj influencers.

## ‚ùó Challenges Faced

While there is a growing demand for Indian Moj influencers in Saudi Arabia, several challenges could hinder the growth of this market. For instance, Saudi Arabian brands are often unfamiliar with influencer marketing, and as such, they may not see the value in partnering with Indian Moj influencers.

In fact, according to recent data, only 13.6% of Saudi Arabian brands are familiar with influencer marketing. This lack of familiarity could reduce the chances of Indian Moj influencers obtaining brand deals in Saudi Arabia, as brands are not willing to invest in what they do not understand. 

Moreover, even if Saudi Arabian brands are familiar with influencer marketing, they may still be reluctant to spend money on it. According to recent data, 45% of marketers in Saudi Arabia pointed out that one of their biggest challenges in influencer marketing is the cost associated with it.

This is primarily because Saudi Arabian brands are accustomed to traditional marketing methods, such as print media and television advertisements, which are often less costly than influencer marketing. As such, convincing Saudi Arabian brands to invest in influencer marketing could be a considerable challenge for Indian Moj influencers seeking brand deals in the kingdom.

## üìä Opportunities for Indian Moj Influencers in Saudi Arabia

Despite the challenges, Indian Moj influencers have several opportunities for securing brand deals in Saudi Arabia that can drive the growth of this market. For instance, the Saudi Arabian government has made several strategic investments to promote tourism in the country as it seeks to diversify its economy away from oil.

According to the Saudi Arabian government, the number of international tourists visiting the kingdom is expected to reach 100 million annually by 2030. This is a considerable increase from the 175 million international tourists that visited Saudi Arabia in 2023. 

As such, Saudi Arabian brands targeting foreign tourists visiting the country are likely to require the services of Indian Moj influencers. This is primarily because the Indian expatriate community constitutes a considerable portion of foreign visitors to the kingdom.

In addition, the Saudi Arabian government has also invested heavily in developing its entertainment sector, with several entertainment initiatives being launched, including the Saudi Seasons. These initiatives are designed to attract tourists and improve the quality of life for residents.

As such, Indian Moj influencers should target Saudi Arabian brands that are a part of the entertainment sector, such as amusement parks, restaurants, and hotels, as these are going to be some of the biggest beneficiaries of the government investment. Additionally, they are also going to be some of the biggest brands in the Saudi Arabian market.

## ü•≥ Conclusion

The Saudi Arabian Moj influencer market is a burgeoning space with ample opportunities for Indian Moj influencers seeking brand deals in the kingdom. While there may be several challenges to this market, they can be overcome with proper knowledge of the Saudi Arabian market, as well as the specific requirements of Saudi Arabian brands. 

The influx of Indian travelers to Saudi Arabia is also an opportunity for Indian Moj influencers, as it helps promote their popularity in the Saudi Arabian market. It is estimated that the Saudi Arabian Moj influencer market is going to reach $3.2 billion by 2025, which indicates just how lucrative this market is for Indian Moj influencers looking for brand deals.
