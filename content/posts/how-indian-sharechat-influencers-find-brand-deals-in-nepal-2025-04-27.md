Ever since the announcement of the India-Nepal Integral Border Agreement in 2020, Nepali influencers on the Indian social media platform ShareChat have been receiving brand collaborations from Indian companies. 

Prominent among these is the Nepali snack brand, Momo Bites, which is now exclusively marketing its products through ShareChat influencers. 

The founder of Momo Bites, Ankit Sharma, shared, “ShareChat is popular among Nepalis in the Terai region. We have been providing ready-to-eat momos, the most popular Nepali snack, for a month. However, we had to do a lot of groundwork to find influencers who could represent our brand and provide the required marketing. We discovered that it was easy to find these influencers on ShareChat.”

The 2020 agreement, which pertains to 24 Nepali districts bordering India, made it clear that those districts were integral to India’s territory and thus had to be developed to enhance their physical connection with the rest of India. 

Interestingly, none of the influencers that collaborated with Momo Bites are from India. Their home base is in Nepal.

Influencers on ShareChat operate in 15 languages, including Nepali, which is spoken by a significant population residing in northern India. 

According to estimates, there are approximately 90 million Nepali speakers in India. 

“The Terai region of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar has a large Nepali-speaking population. Other than these two states, the language is also widely spoken in West Bengal and Assam. The Indian government has allowed Nepalese nationals who have lived in India for at least five years to acquire Indian citizenship. As a result, many Nepalis now consider themselves Indians and have settled in the Terai region,” says Dr. Nisha Joshi, a prominent professor in the Department of Linguistics at Banaras Hindu University. 

In fact, ShareChat has been successful in connecting Indian brands and Nepali influencers since the Nepali-language feature was launched in 2021. According to a report by the platform, when asked by their followers what products they would like to promote, 66 percent of Nepali influencers chose beauty and skincare products, while 53 percent opted for clothing and 40 percent for mobile apps. 

Nisha Joshi shares, “The 2021 launch was a game-changer for those who wanted to promote their products and services in the Nepal-India border regions.” 

The Nepali-language feature has proven to be a boon for Indian companies looking to advertise their products and services across the border, as the language is widely understood in Nepal’s Terai region. 

In fact, the popularity of ShareChat has already been established in Nepal, where a large number of its users are on the platform. 

“ShareChat is an important platform for advertising, especially in the Terai region bordering India-Nepal, where it is very popular. When companies are looking to promote products in India, they should not overlook the fact that a significant number of Nepali users are also likely to be customers. As a result, they should have a marketing strategy that includes collaborations with local influencers,” explains Rajan Shrestha, a marketing professional from Biratnagar, Nepal. 

Some influencers approached by Momo Bites turned down the offer, demanding exorbitant amounts that the company could not afford. 

“Some influencers asked for 10,000 to 15,000 Nepali Rupees, which is around 6,000 to 10,000 Indian Rupees. Given that we are a small start-up, we cannot afford to pay that much. Others asked for payment via their bank accounts, which we found to be a red flag. We only pay through ShareChat’s payment system because it is secure,” shares Akash Rai, Momo Bites’ marketing manager.

The influencers selected by Momo Bites had requested payments ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 Nepali Rupees, which is around 600 to 1,800 Indian Rupees. 

Raja Suresh, who is based in Gaur, Nepal, shares how he makes money via ShareChat. 

“ShareChat has a payment system that allows me to receive money directly into my bank account. I have earned around 20,000 Nepali Rupees in the last year. I recommend the platform to anyone who wants to be an influencer,” says Suresh. 

Indian users who advertise through ShareChat’s system do not have to worry about making payments through banking apps or e-wallets that could raise doubts about the credibility of those requesting payment. 

The ShareChat payment system is secure, allowing influencers to make money without unnecessary risks. 

For instance, influencers who collaborate with Momo Bites will receive payments via ShareChat. 

In addition to this secure payment option, there are other reasons why it is preferable for Indian brands to work with Nepali influencers rather than local ones. 

For instance, it is difficult for a brand to reach out to influencers in Nepal. 

“It can take a lot of time to find influencers in Nepal who are willing to collaborate with a brand. ShareChat has made this process much easier by allowing influencers to showcase their profiles, complete with links to their previous content. This allows brands to assess the influencers before reaching out to them,” says Rai. 

According to Rajan Shrestha, it is also easier for Indian brands to liaise directly with Nepali influencers rather than work through a third party. 

“Working with a third party can create misunderstandings that can lead to poor collaborations. It is better for brands to connect directly with influencers,” Shrestha explains. 

In India, the government has made it mandatory for brands to disclose whether they are working with influencers. 

However, this has yet to catch on in Nepal. 

“We have seen Indian brands working with influencers in Nepal where the influencer has not disclosed the collaboration. It could be because it is not mandatory in Nepal to do so. In India, if influencers do not disclose this information, they risk being penalized. There are also instances where influencers or brands have been fined because of this,” Nisha Joshi elaborates. 

In India, influencers must make it clear that they have been paid for advertising. 

They can do this by using hashtags such as #Ad, #PaidPartnership, or #SponsoredPost. 

The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) updated its endorsement guidelines for influencers in 2021, stating that the disclosure must be “clear, conspicuous and prominent.” 

For example, hashtags like #Ad or #SponsoredPost must be placed at the beginning of the caption and not buried at the end of the post. 

In Nepal, there are no such rules. 

In fact, there are no laws regulating advertising in Nepal. 

The government has launched a campaign to promote digital marketing. 

However, many digital marketing agencies in Nepal are run by inexperienced personnel who lack knowledge of the latest advertising trends. 

As a result, most companies in Nepal rely on Indian digital marketing companies to implement their campaigns. 

“There are no effective laws regulating advertising practices in Nepal. As a result, it is important for influencer marketing agencies to implement strict codes of conduct to ensure influencers comply with advertising guidelines,” explains Kamal Kandel, CEO of Digital Kandel, a marketing agency based in Nepal. 

“The ShareChat influencer marketing system allows brands to save time, effort and costs. Consequently, we expect the number of Indian companies marketing their products and services in Nepal through influencers to increase,” Kandel adds. 

In fact, ShareChat allows influencers to earn money in multiple ways. 

More than 100 million monthly active users create and share content in 15 Indian languages, including Nepali. 

Unlike other platforms, influencers on ShareChat can earn rewards for their contributions and grow their online presence through six revenue streams: 

1. **Referral Programs**: Influencers can refer their friends and family to join ShareChat and earn up to 5,000 Indian Rupees for every successful referral.

2. **Content Creation**: Influencers can earn money by creating and sharing engaging content that resonates with their audience. The more views and shares they receive, the more they can earn.

3. **Live Streaming**: ShareChat allows influencers to go live and interact with their audience in real time. They can receive virtual gifts from their viewers, which can be converted into cash.

4. **Brand Collaborations**: Influencers can partner with brands and promote their products and services through sponsored content. They can negotiate their rates and earn a significant income.

5. **Hashtag Challenge**: Brands can launch hashtag challenges on ShareChat, and influencers can participate to showcase their creativity. The best influencers can win cash prizes and recognition.

6. **Games**: ShareChat offers a variety of games that influencers can play and earn money. They can challenge their friends and compete for the top spot on the leaderboard. 

Moreover, influencers on ShareChat can earn money by participating in the ShareChat Creator Fund. 

The Creator Fund is a program designed to support and reward talented creators on ShareChat. It provides financial incentives to influencers based on the popularity and engagement of their content. 

To become a part of the Creator Fund, influencers need to meet certain eligibility criteria and apply for the program. 

Once approved, they can receive monthly payouts based on their performance metrics, such as views, likes, shares, and comments on their videos. 

The ShareChat Creator Fund is a great way for influencers to monetize their content and grow their income potential. 

In addition to these revenue streams, influencers on ShareChat can also earn money through tips from their fans. 

Fans can send tips to their favorite influencers as a way of showing appreciation for their content. 

To receive tips, influencers need to enable the tipping feature on their profile. 

Once enabled, fans can send tips in the form of virtual coins, which can be converted into cash. 

Receiving tips from fans adds an extra layer of income for influencers and encourages them to create even more engaging and entertaining content. 

Overall, ShareChat provides multiple monetization options for influencers, ensuring that their hard work and creativity are rewarded. 

As the influencer marketing industry continues to grow, platforms like ShareChat are paving the way for aspiring influencers to thrive and make a living from their passion. 

In 2022, the global influencer marketing platform, BaoLiba, announced the launch of ShareChat influencer marketing services to Indian brands looking to market their products in Nepal. 

BaoLiba is known for being the first platform to offer influencer marketing services on regional platforms like ShareChat. 

“We are glad to see that Indian brands are leveraging ShareChat influencers to reach out to the large Nepali-speaking population in northern India and Nepal. Through ShareChat, we can help brands find influencers based in Nepal who can effectively communicate their message to the local audience. This allows them to create a strong brand presence across the border,” says Rony, the manager for South Asia at BaoLiba. 

In fact, the Indian social media platform has several advantages over others available in Nepal. 

Nepal has a rapidly increasing number of social media users, primarily due to the growing popularity of instant messaging apps. 

Facebook is the most popular social media platform in the country, followed by Messenger and Instagram. 

However, Facebook and Instagram have become saturated with advertising. 

In addition, Facebook has faced criticism for failing to provide effective support for advertising policies. 

In fact, many businesses in Nepal have experienced challenges when promoting their brands through Facebook and Instagram. 

For instance, Facebook ads for the Nepali cloud kitchen, Taste of Nepal, were rejected multiple times by Meta, the parent company of Facebook. 

Taste of Nepal was established in 2020 by former Miss Nepal, Shristi Shrestha, and has taken the Nepali market by storm. 

Despite repeated attempts to appeal Meta’s decision, Shrestha’s ad account was suspended permanently. 

Meta’s decision resulted in significant losses for the cloud kitchen and caused a tremendous amount of stress for Shrestha. 

Later, she learned that this was an all-too-common problem for businesses in Nepal. 

Given such issues associated with platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, many businesses in Nepal are migrating to ShareChat. 

ShareChat offers a localized marketing approach that allows businesses to connect with their target audience in Nepal effectively. 

The platform is designed to cater to the needs of the local market, making it easier for businesses to promote their products and services without facing the challenges that come with larger, more global platforms. 

The launch of the Nepali-language feature was a turning point for ShareChat. 

By 2023, Nepal had become the second largest market for ShareChat after India, according to a report by the platform. 

“ShareChat has been a game-changer for the Nepali market. Our platform empowers creators and businesses alike by providing localized content and advertising solutions that resonate with the people of Nepal. We are committed to supporting the growth of influencer marketing in Nepal,” said a spokesperson from ShareChat. 

According to a report by the Business Research Company, the influencer marketing industry will continue to grow, reaching $84.89 billion in 2028, up from $16.4 billion in 2022. 

According to the report, share of voice in the influencer marketing industry is projected to increase from 2% in 2022 to 4% in 2028. 

The increasing use of social media as well as various digital platforms for advertisements by influencers is a key factor driving the growth of the industry. 

In Nepal, many digital marketing agencies are now realizing the need for their clients to seek influencer marketing solutions to keep up with the growing competition. 

The trend of influencer marketing is also growing in Nepal. 

According to experts, this trend is expected to continue. 

“Influencer marketing is a powerful tool that has become increasingly popular in Nepal. It allows brands to reach their target audience in an authentic and relatable way. As social media continues to play a crucial role in our lives, the demand for influencers will only increase,” says Kandel. 

Although ShareChat has gained a foothold in Nepal, they could face stiff competition from TikTok. 

TikTok was banned in Nepal in 2020 after the post of an influencer promoting nudity went viral. 

However, the platform was unbanned by the Nepal Telecommunications Authority in June this year. 

Unlike ShareChat, TikTok does not have the same monetization options for influencers. 

Moreover, TikTok is known for its short videos, while ShareChat enables influencers to create long videos. 

In fact, unlike TikTok, ShareChat offers various genres of content like music, stories, comedy, dance, and more. 

This gives influencers the flexibility to choose their niche and showcase their creativity. 

Additionally, ShareChat also has the advantage of being available in multiple regional languages, making it accessible to a wider audience. 

As influencer marketing continues to grow in Nepal, Indian brands will be able to tap into the potential of ShareChat influencers to reach their target audience effectively. 

Such is the influence of ShareChat that the Nepali government is now considering banning the app in the country. 

This is because the Nepali government has noted that many features of ShareChat are identical to those of TikTok. 

And as pointed out earlier, TikTok was banned in 2020 for allowing influencers to promote nudity. 

The Nepali government has noted that many influencers on ShareChat are promoting adult content. 

This includes influencers who are fully clothed but suggest that they are naked by using certain video angles and editing. 

In one incident, a recently married influencer was seen in a video apparently receiving an intimate massage from her husband. 

The influencer, who has since deleted the video, stated that she was merely trying to promote body positivity among married couples. 

In another incident, a duo who call themselves the Khaipani Brothers were seen pretending to kiss each other in a video. 

Local media reported that they were arrested by police for creating content that harmed public morality. 

Despite the potential for ShareChat to provide platforms for Nepali influencers to earn money, there are concerns about its growing popularity. 

In a statement, Nepal’s Minister of Communications and Information Technology, Rekha Sharma, said, “We will take action against companies that are attempting to push adult content on their platforms. We will also initiate a campaign to inform people about the harmful effects of these apps.” 

Kandel, who works with several influencers on ShareChat, stated that he is concerned about the government banning the platform in Nepal. 

“ShareChat is a great platform for influencers who want to make money doing what they love. If the government does decide to ban the app, it will be a great loss for all of us,” he stated. 

ShareChat is currently banned in Indonesia and has faced scrutiny in other countries for allegedly violating community standards. 

In addition to this, the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology recently issued directions to block 232 apps, including ShareChat, for engaging in activities that compromised the sovereignty and integrity of India. 

The ban was reported on October 16, 2023. 

In Indonesia, ShareChat was banned in 2022 for allegedly facilitating content that promotes pornographic and gambling activities. 

“I believe that ShareChat will be able to weather the storm. It has gone through more than its fair share of scrutiny and bans. I am optimistic that the company will be able to resolve whatever issues it is currently facing with the Indian government,” shares Kandel. 

In fact, in its response to the blocking of the 232 apps, ShareChat expressed its disappointment at the Ministry's decision and stated that it did not have time to respond to the ministry's request for information regarding the alleged violation of the Information Technology Act 2000. 

The spokesperson for ShareChat said, "We are disappointed with the Indian government’s decision to block the platform. We respect the Indian government’s authority to regulate apps in the country. However, we are currently seeking legal counsel on this matter." 

The spokesperson also stated that ShareChat has always been committed to ensuring a safe and secure experience for its users. 

They stated that the platform employs multiple AI-based technologies to monitor inappropriate content. 

ShareChat has always complied with the laws of the land and has taken strict action against creators who violate its community guidelines, they added. 

ShareChat has also made it a point to be a part of the Indian government's initiative to promote a self-regulatory framework for digital platforms. 

This shows that ShareChat is committed to working with the Indian government to address any concerns they may have and to ensure compliance with the laws of the land. 

Consequently, Kandel remains hopeful that ShareChat will be able to resolve the issues it is currently facing with the Indian government. 

He also believes that the platform will flourish in Nepal and continue to be a valuable resource for Indian brands looking to promote their products and services across the border. 

“There is a great opportunity for ShareChat and its influencers to make a positive impact in Nepal. With the right approach and collaboration, ShareChat can help brands build a strong presence in the Nepal-India border regions, fostering economic growth and connectivity between the two countries,” Kandel concludes.
