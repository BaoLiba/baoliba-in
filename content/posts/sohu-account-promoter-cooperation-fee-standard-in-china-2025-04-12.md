## üìä What Are Sohu Influencers?

Sohu has long been a top destination for Chinese netizens seeking news, entertainment, and video content. 

As China's first video platform, Sohu boasts an enormous user base that rivals that of other social media powerhouses like Weibo and Douyin.

Given its expansive reach, Sohu is an attractive option for influencers to build a following and monetize their presence.

Sohu influencers can craft articles and videos on a variety of topics, ranging from lifestyle and travel to technology and finance. 

Each Sohu influencer has a unique niche or area of expertise that drives their content strategy and attracts followers.

### Why Are Sohu Influencers Valuable?

Sohu influencers are valuable to brands looking to make a splash in the Chinese market. 

Statistics show that Chinese consumers have a high affinity for influencer marketing. According to recent reports, 61% of Chinese consumers have purchased a product recommended by an influencer at least once.

Given its long history in the Chinese media landscape, Sohu is a reputable platform where Sohu influencers can reach millions of eyeballs. 

When it comes to having a voice of authority, Sohu influencers can be powerful allies for brands due to their expertise, experience, and established credibility among their followers.


## üí∞ How Much Do Sohu Influencers Charge?

As with other social media platforms, the pricing for promotional posts on Sohu can vary tremendously depending on several factors.

According to BaoLiba‚Äôs 2023 statistics, the average fee charged by Sohu influencers is $253 for an article. 

It‚Äôs important to note, however, that some Sohu influencers may charge thousands of dollars for a single promotional post. 

Conversely, some influencers will charge significantly less than the average of $253.

### What Influencers Charge by Follower Count

This variation in pricing often has to do with following size. 

In the following graphic, we can see how pricing generally increases as follower count rises among Sohu influencers.


| Follower Count | Average Price |
|-----------------|----------------| 
| 1K - 5K         | $5             |
| 5K - 10K        | $15            |
| 10K - 50K       | $44            |
| 50K - 100K      | $138           |

| 1M+             | $2480          |

### Engagement Matters

Follower count isn‚Äôt everything. 

Sohu influencers can have large followings while still failing to generate a substantial return on investment for brands. 

This is why brands looking for Sohu influencers must pay close attention to engagement metrics.

Sohu influencers with high levels of engagement can earn their followers' trust to the point that they are actually inclined to follow through with a purchase after seeing a promotional post. 

As such, Sohu influencers with high engagement rates can charge more for their promotional services.

### Sponsored Posts vs. Other Deliverables 

Pricing will vary depending on the type of deliverable being produced. 

While an article may average $253 in cost, an article + video combo can cost more than double that amount at an average of $529.

Here‚Äôs how pricing breaks down for different deliverables offered by Sohu influencers:


| Deliverable     | Average Price |
|-----------------|----------------| 
| Article         | $253          |
| Video           | $309          |
| Article + Video | $529          |


## üîç What Influencers Charge by Niche

Just as social media platforms have their unique influencers, different niches can also attract different levels of pricing.

Certain niches have been shown to be more lucrative, which can entice Sohu influencers to specialize in one of those areas. 

For brands, knowing the industry pricing by niche can make it easier to identify influencers who fall within budget constraints.

## ‚ùó Influencer Marketing Risks

Despite the many benefits of influencer marketing campaigns, there are also inherent risks. 

It‚Äôs critical for brands to conduct comprehensive due diligence when seeking Sohu influencers for promotional collaboration.

### Fake Followers

As seen on other social media platforms, some Sohu influencers may have bought followers, leading to inflated metrics that create a false sense of popularity. 

Brands should look for signs such as low engagement rates relative to follower count to identify possible fake followers.


### Lack of Authenticity 

Influencer marketing works well when influencers maintain authenticity with their followers.

Brands should avoid Sohu influencers who promote any and every product that comes their way. These influencers are considered ‚Äúsell-outs‚Äù and their followers may sense a lack of authenticity, leading to skepticism about any promotional post.

Brands should look for Sohu influencers that curate product selections to those they truly endorse and use, in order to maintain credibility.


### Not Following Guidelines 

Influencers are required to comply with advertising laws and regulations in their respective countries, including disclosing paid promotions. 

In China, where Sohu is influential, failing to disclose a sponsored post can lead to hefty fines.

Brands seeking Sohu influencers will want to ensure they follow proper disclosure practices both for their own sake and for the influencer's.

This will help brands get a sense of the influencer‚Äôs track record regarding delivering on promotional posts.

### Draft Contracts

Contracts should be drafted that stipulate all deliverables, timelines, and payment terms. 

Contracts should also designate what language should be used for disclosing a sponsored post.
