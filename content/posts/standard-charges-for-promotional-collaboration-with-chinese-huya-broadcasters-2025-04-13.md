As an Indian brand looking to join the influencer marketing juggernaut, you may have come across the burgeoning live-streaming market in China and the local Indian one, and wonder if you could dip your toes in it.

More specifically, if you would find value in influencer marketing collaboration with streamers from Huya Live, one of China‚Äôs biggest streaming platforms.

When it comes to influencer marketing, gaining insight into streamer pricing models is a crucial step in your decision-making process.

So, let‚Äôs dive into the fees Huya influencers charge for their promotional services.

## üí° The Huya Live Ecosystem

Launched in 2014, Huya has swiftly risen to prominence as a popular live-streaming platform in China.

The platform hosts a diverse range of streaming categories, but gaming remains its top attraction, with more than 100 million monthly active users, 70% of whom are under 30 years old.

Unlike the competition, Huya streamers do not just broadcast themselves playing video games.

They engage with audiences through a mix of gaming-related content, music, sports, education, or entire cooking segments.

Engaged audiences shower streamers with virtual gifts purchased with in-platform currency to show their appreciation.

In July 2020, Huya became China‚Äôs largest esports live-streaming platform with 52% market share and boasts top streamers with millions of followers.

Given that 96% of Huya viewers use mobile devices, it is reasonable to assume that it is a suitable place for engagement-driven influencer marketing campaigns targeting Chinese demographics. 

## üìä Huya Streamer Pricing Model

Pricing models for influencer marketing collaboration with Huya streamers have a few distinctive features compared to traditional social media influencers.

Here are the most relevant aspects of Huya streamer pricing models to know:

- **Mediakits are not common:** Unlike traditional social media influencers who provide their following counts and engagement metrics in mediakits, it is difficult to get a clear idea of how popular specific Huya streamers are.
  
  While Huya provides some stats on its website, the best way to gauge a streamer‚Äôs popularity is to check out their live streams and see how many viewers they have in real time. 

- **Pricing ranges widely:** A general pricing model for Huya streamers seems to sit between CNY 1,000 ($146) and CNY 20,000 ($2,900) per hour of promotional content.

  However, as streaming itself is a niche category, it is not uncommon to find collaborations priced in the tens of thousands.

  On the other hand, new or less popular streamers may only charge below the average prices.

- **Payment is almost always in virtual gifts:** Unlike traditional influencer marketing, payment is rarely in cash when collaborating with Huya streamers.

  The bulk of your payment is usually made through virtual gifts purchased with Huya currency.

  One of Huya Live‚Äôs key features is that it allows viewers to use virtual currency bought from Huya to send gifts to streamers in real time.

  While Huya does allow users to convert virtual gifts into cash, the conversion is not direct as gifts have set cash values that are significantly lower than their market price.

  Moreover, Huya takes a steep cut of between 30% to 50% from every gift‚Äôs value, further diminishing the actual cash rewards stemming from virtual gifts.

  As such, if you choose to engage in Huya influencer marketing campaigns, be prepared to get used to the virtual gift transaction system.

## ‚ùó Risks of Working with Huya Streamers

Despite its booming popularity, live-streaming in China is far from a paradise for marketers and advertisers.

Here are some of the key risks you should bear in mind when working with Huya streamers:

- **Huya is a highly saturated market:** Virtual gifting is a popular way to reward Huya streamers for their work.

  However, the sheer number of other brands vying for streamer attention means your promotional content may get lost in the noise.

- **Engagements can be deceptive:** Just like traditional social media influencers, streamer views and interactions can be artificially inflated.

  According to a 2023 article by SupChina, as much as 50% of Huya views may come from bots.

- **Difficulties in measuring success:** Unlike traditional forms of digital marketing, influencer collaborations often have unquantifiable benefits.

  Metrics such as brand awareness or equity are notoriously hard to measure, which can hamper your efforts to prove ROI.

- **The Chinese Government scrutinizes the livestreaming industry:** Because the Chinese government wields so much power over the digital landscape and has a serious bone to pick with gaming, working with Huya streamers carries the risk of running afoul of a variety of laws and regulations. 

  For example, according to Article 22 of the ‚ÄúRegulations on the Administration of Live Broadcasting‚Äù issued by the Cyberspace Administration of China, ‚Äú[the broadcaster] may not endorse or promote the likes of gambling websites, clients, or apps.‚Äù 

  Subpar content or non-compliance can lead to a Huya account being banned, thwarting all your marketing efforts and damaging your brand.

  In the past, Chinese media and police have called out content supported by brands such as PepsiCo, FunPlus, and Hennessy for violating various laws and regulations.

## üéØ How to Find Huya Streamers for Collaborations
