Most Indian influencers from the ShareChat platform utilize local influencer marketing agencies to connect with potential brands in Vietnam.

Many local firms, such as Indian influencer marketing agencies, have exclusive partnerships with Vietnam social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Tiktok.

These agencies help them establish connections with businesses seeking influencer collaborations while navigating local laws, customs, and language barriers.

For instance, renowned Indian influencer marketing agency BaoLiba, has localized branches in over 100 countries worldwide, including Vietnam.

## ü§≥ India ShareChat Influencers In Vietnam

ShareChat is a popular short video platform in India that boasts over 12 million monthly active users and over 1 billion monthly video views. With all its short videos dubbed in 14 different Indian vernacular languages like Telugu, Hindi, Tamil, and Punjabi, it has been a great performer in tier two and tier three Indian cities like Meerut and Kanpur.

However, it has gained little traction outside India and is unknown in Vietnam. This, coupled with the rigorous restrictions imposed by Vietnam‚Äôs social media platforms, makes it difficult for Indian ShareChat influencers to establish local connections with brands in Vietnam. 

They must rely on local influencer marketing agencies to establish partnerships with brands wanting to leverage their influence.

## üìà Research Reports

A report by Omdia titled 'Influencer Marketing: The Future of Brand Promotion' states that:

- 60% of marketers expect to increase their influencer marketing budgets in the coming years
- 61% of marketers will invest more funds into influencer campaigns in 2025

This information highlights that influencer marketing will remain a key strategy for marketers in the coming years. 

With this trend, we can expect the same increase in influencer marketing budgets from Vietnam brands seeking to utilize Indian influencers in the coming years. 

## üéØ Why Vietnam Brands Prefer Indian Influencers

A report by Socialbakers titled 'Global Influencer Marketing Trends 2022' shows that Indian influencers have the highest engagement rates across platforms like TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram.

In the TikTok category, 62% of Indian influencers had a higher engagement rate for brands than influencers from other countries.

This outstanding performance makes Indian influencers a prime target for Vietnam firms seeking to monetize their influence. 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Payment Options for Indian ShareChat Influencers

Most Vietnamese firms prefer to pay their influencers in their local currency, the Vietnam Dong (VND). 

However, the most common banking methods used by most Indian influencers are through bank accounts on the domestic Unified Payment Interface (UPI) and through PayPal accounts. 

The UPI is India's official banking system managed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which allows for real-time payment settlements between one bank account and another.

With Vietnam offering little interoperability with the Indian banking system, many local firms are unable to send payments directly to Indian influencers using UPI.

Instead, many local firms are relying on local influencer marketing agencies to handle payments as they have established methods to send foreign payments to Indian influencers. 

The most common method is through PayPal.

PayPal is a widely-used international money transfer service that allows for secure transactions between individuals and businesses. It is a popular choice for many firms and individuals looking to send or receive payments from abroad.

Most local influencer marketing agencies utilize PayPal to receive funds from local companies and then send the payments to Indian influencers through their personal or business PayPal accounts.

## üìë Legal Considerations

Influencer marketing is subject to laws and regulations across different countries, including Vietnam. Indian ShareChat influencers must adhere to local laws and regulations when engaging in influencer activities in Vietnam. 

These can include advertising standards, consumer protection laws, and any specific regulations relating to social media marketing.

Vietnam has strict laws governing advertising and marketing practices, particularly concerning influencer marketing. 

For example, influencers must ensure that their content adheres to the principles of honesty, truthfulness, and respect for public morality. They should not promote products or services that are illegal, harmful, or contrary to public order. 

Additionally, all advertisements must be clearly identified as such. Influencers should inform their audience when a post is sponsored or contains paid content.

They may also be required to enter into contracts with brands that outline the specific terms and conditions of the collaboration, including payment terms, content requirements, and disclosure obligations.

Failure to comply with local laws and regulations can result in legal consequences, including fines, suspension of accounts, and damage to reputation. 

Therefore, working with local influencer marketing agencies can help Indian influencers navigate these legal requirements and avoid any potential pitfalls. 

## üí∞ Last Word
