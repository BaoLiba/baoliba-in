Much like how Indian entrepreneurs are keenly attuned to the happenings in South Asia, they must also pay attention to Korea, given how frequent K-pop fans from India touch down at Incheon International Airport.



Koreans have developed a streaming culture that is far beyond what we see in India. While Twitch is only just starting to make inroads in our online entertainment landscape, it has already become a staple of Korean life.

Given that the Indian subcontinent is poised to be the next big growth driver for global streaming platforms, companies must capitalize on Korea's Twitch influencers to reach India's sizable middle class.


## üéÆ How Korean Twitch Influencers Stack Up

According to a 2022 report by Streamlabs, 1.6 million Twitch accounts are based in Korea, making it the country's fourth most popular online service.

The heavy concentration of Twitch users signals that Koreans are avid consumers of live-streamed content ‚Äî a trend that Indian users are also gradually adapting to.

Korean Twitch influencers are becoming high-profile celebrities among the nation's youth. Prominent gamers dominate the platform's top rankings, and fourth-generation K-pop stars are increasingly getting in on the streaming action.

As of October 2023, the highest-ranked Twitch streamer from Korea is Lee Sang-hyeok, aka Faker. He is a professional League of Legends player and has amassed over 10.5 million followers on the platform.

Elise, aka K/DA Seraphine, is also a popular Korean Twitch influencer. She is a K-pop star from the fictional musical group K/DA, which is based on the League of Legends characters.

Not only does Seraphine have 3.9 million Twitch followers, but she also boasts a sizeable fanbase on YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok.


## üí∞ The Price of Marketing Collabs

Korean Twitch influencers are opening up their DMs for marketing collaborations with brands, but they are also checking to see if your wallet is fat enough to afford their rates.

According to a 2022 report by Business of Apps, the average price of a marketing post among Korea's Twitch influencers is up to INR 75,000 ($900) per stream. The report highlights that Korean influencers' prices far exceed the prices of those from other Asian countries, including India.

It is highly likely that prices will scale in tandem with the influencer's follower count. For example, according to a post on Korean Business Tree, popular streamers with 10,000 followers charge around INR 24,000 ($290) per marketing collaboration, while those with 20,000 followers can charge up to INR 36,000 ($435).

Given the plethora of Korean Twitch influencers, Indian entrepreneurs can choose to collaborate with influencers who already cater to Indian audiences.

For example, former FIFA streamer Jin Seon-ho, aka Jindo Korea, has a sizeable Indian fanbase and often collaborates with Indian brands. He has over 925,000 followers on Twitch, so Indian brands can likely negotiate prices somewhere around INR 36,000 and INR 75,000 depending on how much Jindo Korea likes you.


## üìú Contracts, Payments, and Popular Platforms

Korean Twitch influencers are professionals and conduct their marketing collaborations as if they were a bona fide business.

As such, they often require Indian firms to sign contracts before collaborating. Popular contracts include rigid clauses that lay out the details of the collaboration, payment deadlines, and stipulated penalties for failure to comply with the contract terms.

Payment is typically done through PayPal. If a brand refuses to pay, the influencer can sue them in Korean courts.


## üõ°Ô∏è Cautions for Indian Firms

The South Korea-based blog Korea Now emphasizes that Indian brands must establish reliable channels to negotiate and set up marketing collaborations with Korean Twitch influencers. Additionally, they must also make sure that they are dissolving their contracts according to proper protocols.

Failing to comply with proper protocols can result in a Korean influencer suing an Indian brand and winning a lawsuit in South Korea. Given that India's influencer marketing laws differ from Korea's, brands must also comply with both countries' respective laws.

Both Korean and Indian businesses looking to capitalize on marketing collaborations with Twitch influencers must approach them through international influencer marketing agencies. Brands can either work with Indian agencies specializing in international influencer marketing or partner with global agencies that have offices in Korea.

Agencies will help brands source suitable Korean Twitch influencers whose follower demographics best match their target audiences.

These agencies will also take care of the nitty-gritty of crafting contracts and payments, so that brands don't have to spend long hours communicating with Korean influencers directly.
