Indian influencers are increasingly finding brand deals with Bangladeshi brands. In fact, brands from Bangladesh are more likely to collaborate with Indian influencers than their own influencers.

This trend is similar to how Indian YouTube influencers were previously getting brand deals from Pakistani brands through backdoor connections in Dubai, Malaysia, and London. 

Today, Indian YouTube influencers have direct access to Bangladeshi brands without the need for backdoor connections because a digital marketing agency based in Bangladesh is connecting Indian YouTube influencers directly with Bangladeshi brands.

So, how are Indian YouTube influencers finding brand deals from Bangladesh?

## üìπ Bangladeshi brands prefer Indian YouTube influencers

Bangladeshi brands prefer collaborating with Indian influencers over their local influencers because Indian influencers have a better understanding of the Bangladeshi audience than the influencers from Pakistan.

According to the digital marketing agency working with Indian influencers, Bangladeshi brands have a higher trust factor for Indian influencers than local influencers.

Bangladeshi brands believe that Indian influencers are more likely to deliver results than local influencers because Indian influencers have a proven track record of delivering results and driving sales for their clients. 

The digital marketing agency testified that they have successfully connected several Indian YouTube influencers with Bangladeshi brands, resulting in long-term collaborations.

## üí∞ Payment in USDT

Bangladeshi brands pay Indian influencers with USDT to avoid currency exchange issues.

Indian influencers get paid around $300 to $500 for brand deals in Bangladesh. Payments are typically settled in USDT because there are no payment service providers such as PayPal to facilitate payments.

Indian influencers also prefer payment in USDT because it takes less transaction fees compared to bank wire transfers that can go as high as $50.

The Indian influencer gets to keep around $290 to $490 after transaction fees when they get paid in USDT for brand deals in Bangladesh.

## üö© High demand for Indian influencers

Indian influencers are in high demand among Bangladeshi brands that have limited options for local influencers.

In fact, Bangladeshi brands are increasingly hiring Indian influencers for brand promotions domestically, especially in major cities such as Dhaka, Chittagong, and Sylhet.

According to a report by the digital marketing agency, 34% of Bangladeshi brands were using Indian influencers for brand promotions locally as of 2023. 

The report also predicted that 55% of Bangladeshi brands will be hiring Indian influencers for brand promotions in 2025.

## üé¨ Indian YouTube influencers dominate Bangladeshi influencer industry

Indian YouTube influencers are dominating the influencer industry in Bangladesh, contributing to the 55% forecast for 2025.

In fact, only 33% of Bangladeshi brands were hiring local influencers for brand promotions as of 2023. This percentage is likely to decrease in 2025 as Bangladeshi brands double down by hiring Indian influencers more.

The digital marketing agency testified that Bangladeshi brands prefer working with Indian YouTube influencers because they have a good understanding of the Bangladeshi culture and audience. 

They also noted that Indian YouTube influencers have a higher reach and engagement than local influencers in Bangladesh.

## ‚òéÔ∏è Contacting Indian influencers

Bangladeshi brands contact Indian influencers through a third-party digital marketing agency specializing in influencer marketing.

Currently, the digital marketing agency is the only one connecting Indian YouTube influencers with Bangladeshi brands. This means that Indian influencers would have to go through the digital marketing agency to get brand deals in Bangladesh.

The digital marketing agency does not only specialize in connecting Indian influencers with Bangladeshi brands. It is also connecting Indian influencers with brands from neighboring countries such as Nepal and Bhutan.

## üéñÔ∏è Credibility

The digital marketing agency is already establishing credibility among Indian influencers looking for brand deals in Bangladesh.

The agency has testimonials from several Indian influencers verifying their successful collaborations with Bangladeshi brands. 

Successful collaborations include Indian YouTube influencers promoting brands such as Grameenphone, the largest mobile network operator in Bangladesh, and Aamra, a digital transformation company based in Bangladesh.

The digital marketing agency is also gaining traction on social media among Indian influencers looking for brand deals in Bangladesh.

## üìÖ 2025 forecast

The digital marketing agency has made a bold forecast that Indian influencers will dominate the influencer industry in Bangladesh by 2025.

The agency predicts that Indian influencers will be collaborating with over 70% of Bangladeshi brands by 2025.

Currently, 34% of Bangladeshi brands are already collaborating with Indian influencers, and this number is expected to rise to over 70% in just two years.

## üö´ Border issues

Despite the high demand for Indian influencers among Bangladeshi brands, border issues could hinder the growth of Indian influencers in Bangladesh.

Indian influencers looking to promote brands from Bangladesh will have to overcome border issues such as strict visa policies and customs restrictions when entering Bangladesh.

Bangladesh has been known to have strict visa policies for Indian nationals. Indian influencers looking to promote brands from Bangladesh will likely have to go through lengthy and bureaucratic procedures to obtain a visa.

Once in Bangladesh, Indian influencers will also have to navigate customs restrictions that could hinder their ability to promote brands from Bangladesh.

It remains to be seen how the growing demand for Indian influencers from Bangladesh will influence border policies between India and Bangladesh.

## üëè Conclusion

Indian influencers are increasingly finding brand deals with Bangladeshi brands. 

In fact, Indian YouTube influencers have become synonymous with the influencer industry in Bangladesh, leaving local influencers struggling to keep up with the unprecedented demand for Indian influencers. 

A digital marketing agency based in Bangladesh is connecting Indian influencers with local brands. 

The agency has made a bold forecast that Indian influencers will dominate the influencer industry in Bangladesh by 2025.

However, border issues could hinder the growth of Indian influencers in Bangladesh.
