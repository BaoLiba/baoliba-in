Influencer marketing in Vietnam is clearly on the rise. The Vietnamese are learning how to pick their noses *and* grow their TikTok pages simultaneously.

If you‚Äôre a business looking to partner with influencers in Vietnam, chances are you‚Äôve already been sent a proposal for a collaboration on both TikTok and Instagram. However, if you‚Äôre not careful, you might end up overpaying‚Äîand missing out on the *real* deal.

## üì¢ Vietnam Instagram Influencer Rates: A Comparative Look

Because Instagram is harder to manipulate, influencers on that platform are usually more expensive than those on TikTok.

After going through dozens of proposals and influencer marketing agencies across Vietnam, I‚Äôve come up with a handy comparison chart of collaboration rates.

| Metric | Instagram | TikTok |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| *10K - 50K* Followers | $300 - $700 | $50 - $300 |
| *50K - 100K* Followers | $700 - $2,000 | $300 - $700 |
| *100K - 200K* Followers | $2,000 - $5,000 | $700 - $1,500 |
| *200K - 500K* Followers | $5,000 - $10,000 | $1,500 - $2,500 |
| *500K+* Followers | $10,000+ | $2,500+ |

## üì¢ Average Costs for Instagram Influencers in Vietnam

According to a local advertising agency that specializes in influencer marketing, the average costs for Instagram influencers in Vietnam are as follows:

- Micro-influencers (10K - 100K followers): $200 - $1,000 per post
- Mid-tier influencers (100K - 500K followers): $1,000 - $5,000 per post
- Mega influencers (500K+ followers): $5,000+ per post

Rates can vary based on factors such as:
- Audience demographics, including the amount of followers located abroad
- Engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments)
- Content type (story, reel, post)
- Exclusivity and usage rights (how long the content can be used for and on which platforms)
- Additional services (photography, videography, makeup, travel expenses)

## üì¢ Why Are Instagram Influencers in Vietnam More Expensive?

Instagram has built-in algorithms that reduce the visibility of posts, and the fact that posts are typically static means they can‚Äôt go viral like videos on TikTok. 

Therefore, when an influencer agrees to collaborate with a brand on TikTok, they stand to gain far more exposure than if they were to post about that brand on Instagram.

That‚Äôs why TikTok influencers are typically cheaper than their Instagram peers. However, the two work best as a marketing duo. That's why many influencers can be found advertising their Instagram accounts on their TikTok pages.

## üì¢ Choose the Right Influencer Marketing Agency in Vietnam

In Vietnam, there are two types of Instagram influencers you can find: authentic and fake. 

There are two types of influencer marketing agencies in Vietnam that can help you as a business target either type: authentic and fake.

Authentic influencers have a noticeable and consistent style throughout their posts. Fake influencers are the ones on a one-way street of imitation. Fake influencers usually come from agencies whose proposals you‚Äôll find to be generic.

Be careful where you shop for influence.

## üì¢ InstaTok: A New Hybrid Type of Influencer in Vietnam

A new breed of influencer is emerging in Vietnam: the InstaToker.

InstaTokers combine the best of both worlds, advertising brands on both platforms. They usually have *@username*.insta and *@username*.tiktok usernames. They also take the time to cross-promote their accounts. Furthermore, many of their posts contain dual branding.

Because of the complexity of managing both types of platforms and the added effort in content creation, InstaTokers have become the most sought-after and potentially the most lucrative type of influencer to collaborate with in Vietnam.

Here are some examples of popular InstaTokers in Vietnam:

- @trangtrandee
- @trangtranay
- @hoanganh90
- @khoikcv

## üì¢ Vietnamese Payment Methods for Influencer Collaborations

Cash is still king in Vietnam. Many influencers prefer to be paid in cash for collaborations. Just like the old days.

## üì¢ Legal Considerations for Influencer Marketing in Vietnam

The **Ministry of Industry and Trade** (MOIT) has stated that influencer marketing is a legitimate form of advertising. However, businesses should ensure that their influencers comply with the relevant advertising laws, such as:

1. *False advertising*: Influencers must not make false claims about products or services in their content. For example, an influencer cannot falsely claim that a beauty product result will work for everyone.
2. *Disclosures*: Influencers must disclose that their posts are sponsored or paid advertisements. For example, an influencer should use hashtags like ‚Äú#Sponsored‚Äù or ‚Äú#Ad‚Äù.
3. *Youth protection*: Influencers must not promote certain products and services to children and adolescents, such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
4. *Protecting consumer rights*: Influencers must comply with the Advertising Law, including regulations on advertising prohibited products and services, and avoiding misleading, coercive, or deceptive advertising.
