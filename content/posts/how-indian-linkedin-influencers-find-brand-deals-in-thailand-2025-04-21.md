Despite their reserved demeanor, Indian LinkedIn influencers are quietly building a lucrative niche in Thailand.

Classically trained in the arts of diplomacy and restraint, these high-performing LinkedIn users operate in the shadows, appearing unencumbered by ostentation and egoism.

And unlike their Instagram brethren who favor bold colors and selfies, LinkedIn influencers tend to rely on a cleaner, more austere palette for their posts.

In a recent post, Indian entrepreneur Hardik Patel used a muted tone and straightforward language to convey the gustative delights of a Thai restaurant. He closed by inviting readers to contemplate a business lunch there. 


### How Indian LinkedIn users secure brand deals in Thailand

The introduction of LinkedIn's brand partnership program has made it easier for influencers to find and secure lucrative brand collaborations.

The initiative allows influencers to showcase their offerings to various businesses, which can research and connect with them directly through the platform.

But even without this program, many Indian LinkedIn influencers have been working with brands for years. 

The influencer Mahendra Poonia, who has over 770,000 followers, recently posted about his partnership with a financial services company that sent him on a weekend retreat to Thailand.

```
Had an amazing time in Thailand with the incredible team of ZEBPAY, India's largest and most trusted Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Exchange, with 5 Million+ Users across 67 countries.
```

In the post, Poonia shared several photos with the team of ZEBPAY, showcasing the company's generosity in treating its employees and partners to an exotic getaway.

```
Fully enjoy the hospitality of the five-star hotel, taste the delicacies of Bangkok cuisine, shop like a king at the biggest mall, enjoy water sports on one of the world's best beaches, and dance like a movie star in a nightclub. 
```

Poonia's post featured the company's branded laptop and phone, as well as a branded thangka, probably the only Thai thing about the trip.

Poonia did not go into detail about his arrangements with ZEBPAY, but services like BaoLiba could have facilitated the partnership.

Founded in 2018, BaoLiba focuses on bridging the gap between global brands and influencers, helping brands identify suitable influencers, and assisting influencers in securing exciting brand deals.

Although more focused on influencer marketing within a brand's home country, BaoLiba can help such international campaigns find local influencers, even for a country as far away as Thailand.

### The real deal in Thailand

Some Indian LinkedIn influencers offer the luxury of virtual companionship in Thailand.

When their clients tire of the sun and sand, they can retire to the cloistered comforts of their hotel rooms for the genuine warmth of authentic Indian hospitality.

Indian influencer and actor Anupriya Sharma recently partnered with a Thailand hotel to boost its romantic offerings.

Sharma, who has over 247,000 followers, promoted the hotel’s honeymoon packages with a photo of herself reclining in bed with a red, heart-shaped balloon and a bouquet of roses.

```
A honeymoon is the first moment a couple gets to enjoy their togetherness. The beautiful memories created during this blissful holiday will remain etched in their minds forever.
```

Sharma assured couples that they can spice up their honeymoon and make it memorable at the Baan Haad Ngam Boutique Hotel in Koh Samui, Thailand.

```
The staff at Baan Haad Ngam will shower you with love and affection, and they will work tirelessly to ensure that all your dreams come true during your stay at the resort. 
```

Sharma concluded the post with three hashtags, one of which was “#Thailover.” 

This hashtag is popular among Indians looking to fulfill their fantasies of going to Thailand, the go-to country for Indian men seeking to lose their inhibitions.

 Thailand is also the top choice among Indian men looking to make the most of their bachelor parties, and Indian LinkedIn influencers have been busy catering to this clientele.

On 10 October, 2023, Indian actor Prateek Bhadouria posted a video of himself enjoying a sumptuous banquet in a Thai hotel room.

```
Things to do in Thailand. Taste delicious food at your hotel room. 
```

The post also featured the hotel staff, dressed in traditional attire, standing by, ready to assist.

But what has caught the most attention is the number of Indian LinkedIn influencers reporting their 'business trips' to Thailand.

Seemingly initiated by the actor and influencer Vandana Sharma, who has over 341,000 followers, this trend is making waves and raising eyebrows.

Recently, Sharma shared a photo of herself against the backdrop of a sunset, dreamy-eyed and draped in a pink gown, standing atop a hill and seemingly contemplating life’s mysteries.

```
When the sun sets, it takes the day with it. All of your memories from today are also fading into the night. The glorious sunset leaves you speechless. 
```

But Sharma was not just enjoying the sunset. She was celebrating another milestone in her influencer career, which began on 1 January, 2000.

```
When I look back at the years gone by, I realize how fortunate I am to have had the privilege of working with amazing organizations, people, and brands. 
```

Sharma claimed she was taking in a moment of stillness to express her gratitude toward the people and organizations that have supported her over the years, many of which are Thai.

```
Thanks a lot for the love and trust, and I promise to keep delivering my best and more. 
```

Commenters started to notice a correlation between posts celebrating career milestones among Indian LinkedIn influencers and the number of those influencers visiting Thailand.

One LinkedIn user asked, “Seems like Thailand is treating you well. Happy for you. Could you share the secret of turning 20 years of experience into a ‘moment of stillness’?”

Things began to spiral out of control when one Indian LinkedIn user claimed that the influx of Indians traveling to Thailand has caused the price of beer to double.

The rumors prompted officials in Thailand to issue a statement to calm the nerves of their Indian counterparts.

```
Thailand is a beautiful country, and the Thai people love Indian visitors. 
```

```
The LEO beer price in Thailand is still the same at a market price of 59 baht. If it has gone up to 120-150 baht, it is due to the policy of some Thai hoteliers. 
```

This was only enough to raise suspicions among certain observers.

```
We buy beer from stores and markets at a wholesale price and then sell it to tourists at a retail price  under a policy of cost pass-through. 
```

It seems that guest service does not include the luxury of fair pricing.

```
In all properties, we set a price for beer and other drinks. 
```

“We will let the department of foreign affairs and trade in Thailand know about this issue so that they can verify the facts about beer pricing,” said the Indian Ministry of Tourism. 

Despite the escalating drama, influencer marketing among Indian LinkedIn users has only just begun.

And like always, it seems that only time will tell where the proverbial chips will fall.
