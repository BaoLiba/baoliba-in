In recent years, Indian-origin influencers have taken the influencer marketing space in the Netherlands by storm, especially influencers producing content on the popular Indian short video app Moj. 

Having found an unending audience base in the Netherlands, especially after the Netherlands government‚Äôs decision to not ban the app, Indian Moj influencers are now establishing a wide-reaching presence in the European nation.

While the influencers find themselves in high demand for partnerships with brands, one major question arises: How do Indian Moj influencers find brand deals in the Netherlands?

üì± **Moj Influencers Networks Reach Out on Instagram**

As a major hub for Indian expats, the Netherlands has a thriving Indian community constantly in touch with its roots through music, cinema, and social media. 

With over 25 crore monthly active users, Moj, the number one short video app in India, has become a major source of entertainment for the locals. 

Moj influencers create different forms of entertaining and engaging content on the app, ranging from comedy skits, dance, and music to information and games, all of which are rooted in Indian culture and heritage.

With almost all Dutch locals being aware of the Moj app through their Indian friends or by themselves, several brands have turned to Indian Moj influencers for promotional campaigns. 

To reach out to the Indian Moj influencers, brand managers and promoters often contact the influencers through DMs on Instagram.

Instagram has become a preferred mode for brands to contact social media influencers. According to a 2023 report by the influencer marketing agency, HypeAuditor, 62% of brands prefer Instagram as the main platform for influencer marketing.

Furthermore, a 2023 survey by SocialSprout found that 70% of marketers plan to continue using Instagram for marketing and advertising in 2024. 

In addition, Instagram is seen as a trustworthy and authentic platform by brands. According to HubSpot's 2023 report on social media trends, 57% of brands reported that Instagram produces more trustworthy influencers than other platforms.

All of these make Instagram a strategic choice for agencies and brands to reach out to Indian Moj influencers in the Netherlands. 

ü§ù **Moj Influencers Networks Help Find Brand Deals**

To help Indian Moj influencers find brand deals in the Netherlands and other European countries, several influencer agencies, especially influencer networks, have established themselves in Europe.

These influencer networks not only help influencers find brand deals, but they also help brands find the right influencers for their promotional campaigns. 

It acts as a middleman between brands and influencers, where they help brands contact influencers, take care of negotiations, and manage payments. 
These networks usually sign a contract with influencers, which allows the network to exclusively represent the influencer regarding brand deals. 

In return, the influencer gets a percentage of the earnings, sometimes ranging between 10% to 35%, depending on the scale of the network and the deals they get for the influencer.

One popular influencer network that focuses on Indian influencers in the Netherlands is Baoliba.

The India-based influencer marketing platform has expanded its reach to over 100 countries, including the Netherlands, to help Indian influencers find brand deals abroad.

In a recent interview, Baoliba‚Äôs CEO, Harry Jhon, said that the only difference between Indian influencers and native influencers is that the former produces content in Hindi or other regional languages.

Harry added, ‚ÄúWhen it comes to dealing with brands, Indian influencers are no less than local influencers. Brands can be assured that Indian influencers can resonate with the local audience.‚Äù

üåç **Major Indian Brands Are Tapping Indian Moj Influencers in the Netherlands**

While several local brands in the Netherlands have begun to contact Indian Moj influencers for promotions, several Indian brands have also begun to tap into this influencer market.

In fact, some major Indian brands have begun to collaborate with Indian Moj influencers in the Netherlands for their promotional campaigns.

One major Indian brand that has collaborated with Indian Moj influencers in the Netherlands is the Indian heritage fashion brand, Fabindia. 

Fabindia recently launched its stores in the Netherlands and collaborated with several Indian Moj influencers in the nation for promotions. 

Moj influencers like Afsar And Another, Keya, and Shashank Sonkar posted videos on the app showcasing Fabindia‚Äôs products and inviting locals to their stores. 

The Fabindia collaborations are not the first promotions for Moj influencers in the Netherlands. 

Kohinoor, India‚Äôs number one basmati rice brand, has also collaborated with several Moj influencers in the Netherlands for promotions of its premium rice in the European country. 

In a 2023 press release, Kohinoor announced its collaboration with over 15 Indian Moj influencers in the Netherlands. 

Kohinoor‚Äôs Vice President for Europe, Moray Sutherland, said, ‚ÄúKohinoor Rice has been a staple for generations, especially in the Indian diaspora, and our goal is to promote awareness and consumption of the brand across the EU. 

‚ÄúIn this regard, we‚Äôve aligned with 15 well-known Indian content creators in the Netherlands who will showcase the brand to their followers over the coming weeks through high-quality videos and posts.‚Äù 

üìä **Moj Influencers Rate Cards for Europe**

Despite being perceived to be high in demand and a premium choice for brand partnerships, Indian Moj influencers in the Netherlands charge reasonable rates for their services.

In fact, Moj influencers who are members of influencer networks have pre-decided rates based on their follower count and the services offered.

Majority of the influencers depend on these rate cards to quote prices for brand deals. 

For instance, influencers like Ashish Srivastava and Ayushman Soni, who are members of the Baoliba influencer network, have the following rate cards:

- 1, 00,000+ followers = 50 to 80 euros for a video or post
- 10,000 to 99,999 followers = 30 to 50 euros for a video or post
- 1,000 to 9,999 followers = 5 to 15 euros for a video or post

While the influencers can negotiate a higher price depending on the complexity of the content that needs to be created, the above rates are still a bargain for brands especially when compared to influencers in the US or Canada who might charge anywhere between 120 to 1,000 euros for a video. 

ü™ô **Indian Payment Methods Ease Payments for Moj Influencers**

While influencer networks help brands contact Indian Moj influencers and make payments for brand deals, there have been cases where brands choose to contact influencers directly or brands decide to work with influencers who are not members of networks. 

In such cases, payments can be made directly by brands to influencers. 

Many brands often wonder if they will face issues while making payments to Indian influencers in the Netherlands, especially since they are located in a different continent.

However, brands have no need to worry, thanks to the ease of international payments offered by several Indian payment platforms and apps. 

Popular international payment apps like Wise, Payoneer, and Razorpay all allow brands to easily send money to Indian influencers in the Netherlands.

Moreover, these apps allow brands to send payments in euros while allowing Indian Moj influencers to receive payments in Indian rupees, thus eliminating any hassle of currency exchange.

‚≠ê **Indian Moj Influencers in the Netherlands: An Emerging Market**

Over the past few months, Indian Moj influencers have emerged as market leaders in the influencer marketing space in the Netherlands.

Due to the cultural similarities shared by the Indian and Dutch communities, Indian Moj influencers have been able to tap into a huge audience base, thus attracting the attention of several brands.

As demand for Indian Moj influencers for brand partnerships continues to grow, several influencer networks have begun to establish themselves in the country to help influencers find brand deals.

While many local Dutch brands have begun to tap into the Moj influencer market, several major Indian brands have also begun to collaborate with Indian Moj influencers in the Netherlands.

Furthermore, Indian Moj influencers charge reasonable rates for their services, making them a lucrative option for brands.

Finally, the arrival of popular Indian payment platforms and apps in the European market has eased the process of payments for brands, while allowing Indian Moj influencers to receive payments in Indian rupees. 

These factors signify that the Indian Moj influencer market in the Netherlands is set to witness huge growth in the near future.
