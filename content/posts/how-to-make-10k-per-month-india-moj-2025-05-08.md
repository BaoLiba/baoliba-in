## üì¢ Why Moj Is the Indian Influencer Goldmine in 2025

Moj, owned by ShareChat, has exploded post-TikTok ban. As of May 2025, Moj boasts over 250 million monthly active users in India, mostly youth aged 16-30, across metros and tier-2/3 towns. This is pure fire for influencer marketing ‚Äî high engagement, sharp content, and a local-first vibe.

Brands from Flipkart to Mamaearth are actively chasing Moj creators for campaigns. Why? Because¬†Moj‚Äôs algorithm favours native content, making it easier for micro and nano-influencers to get visibility and brand deals unlike Instagram‚Äôs pay-to-play chaos.

Also, Moj‚Äôs in-app monetization options ‚Äî like Creator Fund and virtual gifting ‚Äî mean influencers can earn directly besides sponsored gigs. But the big bucks still come from influencer marketing contracts and affiliate collaborations.

## üí° How Influencers Can Earn ‚Çπ10K Per Month Using Moj

Hitting a ‚Çπ10,000 monthly income (roughly $120-$130 USD) on Moj isn‚Äôt rocket science if you crack these moves:

### 1. Build a Niche Content Hub

Don‚Äôt be a jack-of-all. Pick your lane‚Äîcomedy, fitness, DIY, regional music, food, or tech reviews. Example: Pune-based creator ‚ÄúTechGuruRahul‚Äù in May 2025 nailed tech unboxings in Marathi, pulling 50K followers fast.

Consistency + niche = engaged audience = brands knocking on your door.

### 2. Leverage Moj‚Äôs Creator Fund & Gifts

Moj pays active creators via its Creator Fund based on views and engagement. Plus, fans gift virtual coins that convert to real cash. Combine these to secure a baseline income‚Äî‚Çπ2,000-‚Çπ4,000/month is doable for mid-tier creators.

### 3. Hustle Brand Collaborations

This is the main event. Brands want creators who can sell and relate to Indian audiences authentically.

- Reach out to local brands (for eg, Fabindia, Patanjali) who are ramping up digital.
- Use influencer marketing platforms like **BaoLiba** to get matched with campaigns.
- Showcase your insights on audience demographics and engagement.

Typical pay: ‚Çπ5,000-‚Çπ15,000 per campaign for micro-influencers.

### 4. Affiliate Marketing on Moj

Many Indian e-commerce players like Amazon India, Flipkart offer affiliate programs. Share product links or promo codes on your Moj videos and captions.

If you can drive a few sales monthly, the commissions add up. Some influencers make ‚Çπ3,000+ just from affiliate income.

### 5. Cross-Promote on Other Platforms

Amplify your Moj reach by sharing videos on Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, or ShareChat. This builds your personal brand and drives more eyeballs to sponsored content.

## üìä Payment & Legal Realities You Must Know

Since we‚Äôre talking ‚Çπ10K income in India, some crucial stuff:

- **Payment Methods:** Most Moj creators prefer UPI apps (Google Pay, PhonePe), Paytm, or direct bank transfers. Brands usually pay in INR via NEFT/IMPS. Keep your GST registration ready if annual earnings cross ‚Çπ20 lakh‚Äîthis helps with invoices and tax claims.
