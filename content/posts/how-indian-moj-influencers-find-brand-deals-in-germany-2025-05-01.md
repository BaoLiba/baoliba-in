Indian influencers on Moj have invaded Germany!

The 15-second short video platform, owned by the Times Group, has gained immense traction among the youth in India and globally. The app allows creative minds to showcase their talent and earn money from it. 

With more than 120 million downloads and over 30 million monthly active users, Moj is the fastest-growing app in India. 

Unlike other social media platforms, users on Moj don‚Äôt need to have a massive following to monetize their talent. The app offers multiple income streams to its creators, including brand and live-stream deals.


## üöÄ Explore the Moj Influence

Launched in 2020, Moj is a direct competitor to TikTok and is often referred to as the "desi TikTok".

The app allows users to showcase their talent through 15-60 second videos across various genres such as comedy, dance, acting, and more.

The app has rapidly gained popularity due to its easy-to-use interface, diverse content, and zero dependency on international servers.

This has led to a massive influx of creators on the platform, with over 5 million creators producing content daily.

The app has its own Moj Stars program to help creators reach new heights. The program provides a dedicated dashboard with insights on earnings, views, and followers. Additionally, creators have access to exclusive brand deals and live-streaming opportunities.

With the support of the Times Group behind them, Moj influencers have successfully secured deals with international brands like McDonald's, Unacademy, and Boots.


## üåç The Germany-Moj Connection

Germany is the largest European economy and the fourth largest globally. It has the largest population in the European Union with over 80 million residents.

Germany is known for its rich culture, history, and contributions to art, philosophy, and music.

Moreover, it is also one of the top cosmopolitan countries, with 12% of the population being foreign residents.

In recent years, Germany has become increasingly popular among Indians looking to settle abroad. In 2023 alone, the German government awarded over 30,000 visas to Indian nationals.

The growing ties between the two countries have led to a massive increase in trade and commerce. This has also attracted Indian brands to Germany, further boosting the demand for Indian influencers.  


## üì∫ The Moj Influencer Marketing Scene in Germany

Indian brands are increasingly turning to Indian influencers in Germany to reach the growing Indian population in the country. 

Influencer marketing is a popular method for brands to promote their products and services through the voices of relevant individuals within a specific niche. This is particularly effective among younger demographics who tend to trust the opinions of their peers over traditional advertising methods.

Brands often work with influencers across various platforms, including Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. However, due to the unique nature of Moj, brands are finding it easier to convert followers into customers.

Moj is known for its authenticity and realness, which helps build trust with followers. This is something that many brands struggle to achieve through traditional advertising methods.

As a result, brands are increasingly turning to Moj influencers to help them promote their products and services to the growing Indian population in Germany.

Since most brands work through marketing agencies, some of the most prominent agencies in India, such as Fynd, Chitrakoot Media, and InfluencerSutra, have set up shop in Germany. 

These German agencies are not only helping Indian brands penetrate the German market but also connecting Indian influencers with Indian brands.

He has also been featured on several media outlets in India and Germany, including Times of India, ABP News, and India TV.


## üí∏ Payments for Brand Deals

Even though Germany is a EU member, it still has its differences from India, especially regarding currencies. 

The official currency in Germany is the Euro, while in India, it is the Indian Rupee.

As a result, payments made to Indian influencers in Germany are often made in Euros. This can lead to confusion and delays in payments, as Indian influencers often have to convert the currency back to Indian Rupees.

Fortunately, there are several solutions available for Indian influencers looking to get paid in Euros. 

One of the most popular solutions is to use an international payment provider such as Wise or PayPal. These providers allow users to send and receive money in multiple currencies, including Euros and Indian Rupees.

Additionally, Indian influencers can also open a local bank account in Germany. This will allow them to receive payments in Euros without having to convert the currency.

Despite the challenges, Indian influencers in Germany are making a name for themselves and paving the way for others to follow suit.


## üìú What do German Laws Say?

When it comes to influencer marketing in Germany, there are strict laws and guidelines that must be followed. 

One of the main laws that influencers must adhere to is the Telemedia Act (TMG). This law requires influencers to disclose any paid partnerships or sponsorships in their content.

In practice, this means that influencers must clearly state when they are being paid to promote a product or service. This can be done through hashtags such as #ad or #paidpartnership, or by simply stating it in the caption of the post.

Failure to disclose paid partnerships can result in hefty fines and legal repercussions for both the influencer and the brand.

In addition to adhering to the TMG, influencers must also comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This regulation protects the privacy and data of individuals within the European Union, including Germany.

As a result, influencers must obtain explicit consent from individuals before using their personal data, such as their name or image, in their content. 


## ‚ùó What about Taxes?

When it comes to taxes, Indian influencers in Germany are subject to the same laws and regulations as any other individual or business operating within the country. 

This means that influencers must pay income tax on any earnings they make from brand deals or other income-generating activities.

In Germany, income tax rates vary depending on an individual's income level. For the 2023 tax year, the rates range from 0% to 45%. Additionally, influencers may also be required to pay value-added tax (VAT) on certain goods and services.

Fortunately, the Indian government has a tax treaty in place with Germany, which helps prevent double taxation. This means that Indian influencers in Germany may be able to receive credits for taxes paid in Germany when filing their taxes in India.

Overall, while there are some challenges and complexities involved, Indian influencers in Germany are thriving and finding success in their endeavors.

As the popularity of social media and influencer marketing continues to grow, it is likely that we will see even more Indian influencers making their mark in Germany and beyond.


## üí° Tips for Indian Moj Influencers to Secure Brand Deals in Germany

Here are several strategies that Indian influencers in Germany can use to increase their chances of landing brand deals:

1. **Focus on the Indian Diaspora**

One of the most effective ways for Indian influencers to attract brand deals in Germany is to cater to the Indian diaspora. With over 1.5 million Indians in Germany, there is a massive market for products and services that cater specifically to this demographic. 

By focusing on the needs and preferences of the Indian diaspora, Indian influencers can position themselves as valuable partners for brands looking to target this audience.

2. **Use English and Hindi**

While many Germans speak English, it is not their first language. As a result, many Germans may struggle to understand content that is only in English.

By incorporating Hindi into their content, Indian influencers can make it more relatable and accessible to their target audience. This can help increase engagement and attract the attention of brands looking for influencers with high levels of engagement.

3. **Use Instagram and Moj Together**

Instagram is one of the most popular social media platforms in the world, with over 1 billion active users. 

By using Instagram in conjunction with Moj, Indian influencers can reach a wider audience and increase their chances of landing brand deals.

For example, influencers can use Instagram to promote their Moj videos and drive traffic to their profiles. They can also use Instagram Stories to provide behind-the-scenes glimpses of their daily lives and creative processes. This can help build a stronger connection with their audience and make them more attractive to brands.

4. **Work with German Agencies**

As mentioned previously, several German agencies are connecting Indian influencers with Indian brands.

By working with a reputable agency, Indian influencers can tap into their expertise and resources to help them land more brand deals. 

Agencies typically have established relationships with brands and know what they are looking for in an influencer partner. This means that they can help Indian influencers position themselves in a way that makes them more attractive to brands.

Furthermore, agencies often have a deeper understanding of the market and can provide valuable insights and guidance on how to succeed as an influencer in Germany.

5. **Don‚Äôt Forget the Power of SEO**

Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of optimizing content to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs). By using SEO techniques, Indian influencers in Germany can increase their visibility and attract more brand deals.

For example, influencers can use relevant keywords in their captions and hashtags to make their content more discoverable. They can also use tools like Google Trends to identify trending topics that they can create content around. 

By leveraging the power of SEO, Indian influencers in Germany can increase their chances of landing brand deals and growing their influence.
