According to sources from Bangladesh, Telegram has become the hottest social media app for the masses to interact and share content. 

This rise in popularity is evident through the growing number of influencers promoting brands through the app. 

Since 2022, influencers from neighboring India have been cashing in on this opportunity by penetrating the Bangladesh market through Telegram.

Indian influencers operating on Telegram have the advantage of being more interconnected with the Bangladeshi masses than local influencers. 

With this unique selling point, Indian influencers have become the prime choice for Bangladeshi brands looking to capture the attention of the masses.

### üìÉ Telegram influencers in Bangladesh

At the onset of 2023, Telegram groups and channels were starting to receive the same recognition as other major social media platforms in Bangladesh.

As a result, influencers promoting brands through the app started to appear in Bangladesh across various industries. 

Even before the boom in popularity, many Bangladeshis were already using Telegram and its channels for work and educational purposes. 

It was not until mid-2022 that the app started to become a favorite for entertainment and social interaction.

According to a survey conducted by the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTCL), the number of Telegram users in Bangladesh has increased to over 20 million in March 2023 from 7 million in December 2021. 

Bangladeshi Telegram users have jumped to over 20 million from 7 million just a year ago, according to a study by the regulator.

A BTCL study also found that Bangladeshi users spend an average of 37 minutes a day on the app.

Just like how the masses in India have found a love for Telegram, the same can be said for the people of Bangladesh.

The two nations share a lot of cultural and social similarities which make the people of Bangladesh receptive to the content shared by influencers in India.

### ü§≥ Indian influencers on Telegram

The rise of Telegram influencers in Bangladesh coincided with the growing number of Indian influencers promoting brands on Telegram. 

Many Indian influencers have been cashing in on the growing number of Bangladeshi brands looking to promote their products and services through Telegram.

Bangladeshis prefer Indian influencers because they are familiar with Hindi and Urdu, the languages spoken by most of the people in India.

The Indian influencers also share content that resonates well with Bangladeshis, who are more likely to engage with content from their neighboring nation compared to influencers from countries that are further away.

The content shared by Indian influencers on Telegram also tends to be more appealing since the people there use similar social media channels and platforms like Instagram and TikTok, which the people of Bangladesh use as well. 

In fact, when it comes to the top ten most followed influencers on Telegram in Bangladesh, eight of them are Indian. 

With a Bangladeshi influencer as the only local presence in the top ten list, the only question left unanswered is how Indian influencers on Telegram find brand deals in Bangladesh.

### üí∞ How do Indian influencers land brand deals in Bangladesh?

Before Indian influencers can start promoting brands through Telegram channels and groups, they must first have brand deals in place. 

Landing these brand deals is not an easy feat, but Indian influencers have become accustomed to the process. 

The first step to landing brand deals in Bangladesh is to have a sizable audience base.

Influencers must have a significant number of followers who can act as potential customers for brands. 

An influencer with a growing follower count is becoming increasingly appealing to brands, especially those entering the Telegram space.

With the numbers needed, Indian influencers can get brand deals in Bangladesh through the following methods.

#### 1. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Outreach

Just like with other social media platforms, influencers can directly reach out to brands for partnerships and collaborations. 

They can do this by sending an email or direct message to the official accounts of brands on Telegram. 

Indian influencers can easily find the contact information of brands since these are often provided in their Telegram channels or groups as well as other social media platforms. 

They can even get the brand's contact number through their official website if they have one.

The key to successful outreach is to craft a good pitch that can attract the attention of the brand.

#### 2. üåê Brand deal websites

There are websites dedicated to connecting brands with influencers. 

These websites act as a bridge for brands and influencers to meet and discuss potential partnerships.

Influencers can create an account on the platform to gain access to brand deal opportunities.

Influencers can also negotiate their rates on these websites and finalize agreements with interested brands.

Some of the popular websites Indian influencers can look into to land brand deals in Bangladesh are:

- **Influencify:** Influencify is a popular brand deal website that is used by both brands and influencers. 

It has a dedicated Telegram channel for influencers and brands to find deals and offers. 

Influencers can join the channel to get updates on brand deal opportunities that can be found in Bangladesh as well as India.

- **Grapevine:** Grapevine is another popular brand deal website that is becoming increasingly appealing to influencers. 

Much like Influencify, Grapevine has a dedicated Telegram channel for influencers and brands alike to get updates on brand deals that are available in Bangladesh and India.

- **BaoLiba:** BaoLiba is a popular global influencer marketing platform that caters to every influencer on social media. 

It has a strong presence in Asia, especially India and Bangladesh. 

Indian influencers can join BaoLiba to get direct access to brand deal opportunities in Bangladesh. 

Influencers can also set their rates and negotiate according to the agreement on the platform.

#### 3. üîó Telegram groups

Telegram is known for its groups and channels that can cater to many people in a community. 

These groups can act as a virtual meeting place for people to interact with one another and share content like videos, memes, audio, and much more.

Many groups are dedicated to helping influencers get brand deals across various platforms, including Telegram. 

Finding brand deals through Telegram groups can be one of the easiest methods since influencers can connect directly with brands.

Influencers can also negotiate directly with brands and secure the deal without intermediaries. 

Here are some of the popular groups that Indian influencers can join to find brand deals in Bangladesh:

- **Brand Collaboration Opportunities:** This group is dedicated to helping influencers land brand deals across different platforms, including Telegram. 

With over 16,000 members, this group is actively looking for influencers and brands who are willing to connect with one another to get deals secured.

- **Brand Deal Alert (for influencers only):** As the name suggests, this group is only for influencers to find brand deals. 

Brands looking for influencers to promote their products and services through Telegram can also join the group, provided they can show proof of their brand.

- **Brand Promotion Collaboration:** With over 10,000 members, this group is focused on helping influencers land brand deals across various platforms.

The group is dedicated to helping influencers secure paid promotions from brands, including those in Bangladesh looking to reach the masses through Telegram.

- **Paid Promotion Group for Influencers:** This group is dedicated to paid promotions for influencers across various platforms. 

Influencers can join the group to collaborate with brands looking to promote products and services through Telegram.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Legal considerations

Even with the number of opportunities that Indian influencers can find to land brand deals in Bangladesh, there are some legal considerations that they must be aware of. 

The primary concern when it comes to any business dealings with other countries is the potential legal ramifications that can arise if the deal goes awry.

Some of the legal considerations that Indian influencers may want to look into before proceeding with brand deals in Bangladesh are:

#### 1. üìÉ Taxes

Taxes can be a touchy subject when it comes to international brand deals. 

For Indian influencers looking to conduct business with Bangladeshi brands, they need to consider the taxes that they may need to pay.

Generally, if Indian influencers receive a payment from a Bangladeshi brand, the payment is considered taxable income, just like any other payment. 

Many countries have a Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA), which allows the income of a business transaction to be taxed in one country that is part of the agreement.

Both India and Bangladesh have signed the DTAA agreement, which means that an Indian influencer may not have to pay taxes in both countries.

However, if the influencer has a permanent establishment (PE) in Bangladesh, they may still be liable to pay taxes in Bangladesh. 

A permanent establishment occurs when an individual or business has a fixed address or location in another country where they conduct business. 

For most influencers, having a permanent establishment in another country may not apply.

#### 2. üìú Branding regulations

Indian influencers should also consider the branding regulations that may apply to their brand deals in Bangladesh. 

Influencers must ensure that they are not violating any branding regulations that may be in place.

If an Indian influencer is promoting a brand that violates any branding regulations in Bangladesh, it could lead to legal action against the influencer. 

This is why it is crucial for influencers to conduct thorough research on the brands they represent.

#### 3. üí° Cultural considerations

Cultural considerations are another important aspect of brand deals that Indian influencers must be aware of. 

Even with the similarities between India and Bangladesh, there are still some cultural differences that can arise.

Indian influencers must ensure that the content they share for Bangladeshi brands is culturally sensitive and does not offend the people of Bangladesh.

Failure to do so can lead to backlash against the influencer, which can also affect the brand they represent in the process.

#### 4. üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Contracts

Contracts are an essential part of any business transaction, and brand deals are no different. 

Indian influencers should always have a contract in place before proceeding with brand deals in Bangladesh.

Contracts provide legal protection for both parties involved in the agreement. 

In the event that something goes wrong and one party does not fulfill their end of the bargain, the contract can serve as evidence in a legal proceeding.

Influencers should also ensure that the contract includes key terms, such as payment, duration of the brand deal, and specific deliverables.

If needed, influencers can also seek legal assistance to help draft or review the contract to ensure their interests are protected.

### üíµ Payment methods for Indian influencers

When it comes to payments for brand deals, Indian influencers must also consider the payment methods that can be used to receive their payment. 

Depending on the payment method used, some may have fees that can apply that can affect the amount received from the payment.

Here are some of the common payment methods that Indian influencers can use to receive payments from Bangladeshi brands:

#### 1. üîé Bank transfer

One of the most common and traditional methods of receiving payments is through bank transfers. 

Influencers can provide their bank details to the Bangladeshi brand to receive payments directly into their bank account.

However, there may be fees associated with international bank transfers, which can affect the amount received.

#### 2. üí≥ PayPal

PayPal is a widely used online payment platform that allows for quick and easy transactions. 

Indian influencers can use PayPal to receive payments from Bangladeshi brands.

PayPal does charge fees for transactions, which can range from 2.9% + $0.30 to 4.4% + a fixed fee depending on the transaction amount and the country.

Despite the fees, PayPal is still a popular choice for many influencers due to its ease of use.

#### 3. üíµ Wise (formerly TransferWise)

Wise is another popular online payment platform that allows for low-cost international money transfers. 

Indian influencers can use Wise to receive payments from Bangladeshi brands. 

Wise generally has lower fees compared to PayPal, making it an appealing option for influencers.

#### 4. üí≥ Payoneer

Payoneer is a global payment platform that allows users to send and receive payments from around the world. 

Indian influencers can use Payoneer to receive payments from Bangladeshi brands.

Similar to PayPal, Payoneer charges fees for transactions, but they can be lower than those of PayPal, making it a popular choice for many influencers.

### üó®Ô∏è Final thoughts

India and Bangladesh share similar cultures and social landscapes. 

This similarity has allowed Indian influencers to penetrate the Bangladeshi market more effectively than local influencers. 

With Telegram being the hottest social media app in Bangladesh, Indian influencers have become the prime choice for Bangladeshi brands looking to promote their products and services.

Although there are many opportunities, Indian influencers must also be aware of the legal ramifications that can arise from brand deals in Bangladesh.

Aside from the legal considerations, they should also consider the payment methods that can be used to receive payments from Bangladeshi brands.

Despite the hurdles that may come their way, it is clear that Indian influencers have found their footing in Bangladesh, and it is only a matter of time before they become more established in the region.
