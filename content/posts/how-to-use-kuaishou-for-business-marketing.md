If you want to create a business account, you will need to use an existing personal account to upgrade to a business account. 

Next, you will be prompted to register with a mobile phone number. 

You can register with an existing phone number and then receive a six-digit verification code via SMS. Input that code and select ‚ÄúConfirm‚Äù. 

You must also create a password, which can be done by either selecting the option for a password generated by Kuaishou or creating your own password. 

Next, select ‚ÄúProfile‚Äù and select the option to ‚ÄúSwitch Account‚Äù. 

You will then need to provide a business license for your business account. 

Once you have provided your business license and other required materials, you can select ‚ÄúSwitch to Business Account‚Äù.¬†

After switching to a business account, you can manage multiple accounts from the Kuaishou app.

## ‚ùó Risks of Kuaishou Marketing

While Kuaishou has distinct advantages over TikTok, there are still risks associated with Kuaishou marketing strategies.

Kuaishou is primarily a Chinese app, and most of its users are located in China. This means that Kuaishou‚Äôs business marketing opportunities are mainly for businesses that have products and services aimed at the Chinese market.

Kuaishou also does not currently have an English version of its website. If your business relies on Kuaishou Ads, Kuaishou storefronts, and Kuaishou influencer marketing, you may need a Kuaishou marketing agency to manage your business account, and that may take an additional investment.

Despite these potential barriers, Kuaishou is a robust video-sharing platform that offers various marketing opportunities for businesses serious about penetrating the lucrative Chinese market.
