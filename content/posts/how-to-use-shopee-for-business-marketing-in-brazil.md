In the vast, bustling markets of Brazil, one digital platform is setting the stage for businesses to reach millions. Shopee is taking the Brazilian eCommerce scene by storm, and with it comes opportunities to partner with local influencers to grow your brand.

So how can Indian brands leverage Shopee to reach those millions? 

## Shopee has Become a Heavyweight in Brazil

Shopee Brazil is growing at breakneck speed. 

In July 2023, Shopee Brazil became the most downloaded shopping app in Brazil, surpassing competitors like Amazon, AliExpress, and Mercado Libre. Shopee has always been a dominant player in Southeast Asia, but now it is establishing itself in Latin America. 

According to Statista, Shopee became the most used shopping app in Brazil with 34.5 million users, overtaking its closest competitor Mercado Libre at 29 million. Shopee Brazil is now the most downloaded shopping app in Brazil.

What sets Shopee apart? 

Known for its gamification, Shopee uses daily discounts, free shipping vouchers, and a fun user experience that keeps customers returning.

Brazilian users are particularly attracted to Shopee’s free shipping program. According to a February 2023 report by Similarweb, 47% of users stated that free shipping was the primary reason they would use Shopee over competitors.

And as Shopee’s Brazilian users continue to grow, so too does its influence over the Brazilian market.

## The Power of Influencers on Shopee Brazil

In Brazil, social media influencers have a stronghold over consumer behavior. According to a 2023 study by GfK, 45% of Brazilians feel that influencers have a lot of credibility, while 75% say that influencers make them more likely to buy a product.

With a massive audience, influencers have the power to sway the purchasing decisions of millions. 

When it comes to shopping online, Brazilian consumers are no different. According to Shopee’s survey, 67% of Brazilian consumers are heavily influenced by social media when shopping online. 

While Shopee Brazil has an impressive user base, it will take more than simply opening an account to tap into that audience. 


### Shopee Brazil Influencer Program

To grow its presence in Brazil, Shopee has opened an influencer program that allows social media influencers to partner with brands on the platform. 

The Shopee influencer program is open to any influencer with a Brazilian audience, regardless of their follower count. 

By joining the Shopee influencer program, influencers can promote Shopee brands in exchange for commission on sales generated through their efforts. 

Shopee influencers can earn up to 8% commission on every sale through their links, plus a bonus for each new registered user. 

The program is open to anyone who can promote Shopee brands, including content creators, social media influencers, bloggers, and YouTubers. 

Once registered, influencers will be provided with a unique link to a Shopee store, including the store ID, which they can share in their posts. Influencers can create posts linking to specific products, which customers can purchase directly through the link to the Shopee store. 

What’s more, once registered, influencers have access to a dashboard that tracks clicks, orders, and earnings in real-time. 

As influencers continue to earn commission through their Shopee links, they can climb the ranks of Shopee Brazil’s influencer program. There are four levels of influencers, including:

- **Starter**: 0 to 19 approved clicks
- **Basic**: 20 to 99 approved clicks
- **Intermediate**: 100 to 499 approved clicks
- **Advanced**: 500 or more approved clicks

Brazilians are rabid consumers of social media, and influencers wield massive influence. By partnering with Shopee Brazil influencers, Indian brands can tap into millions of potential customers.

## How to Get Started with Shopee Brazil Influencers

Getting started with Shopee Brazil influencers is easy. 

To join Shopee Brazil’s influencer program, brands must first meet eligibility requirements. 

Brands must sell on the Shopee platform and have a Shopee Seller Center account. In addition, brands must have at least three products ready to sell. 

Once these requirements are met, Shopee sellers can apply to become Shopee partners. Applications are reviewed by the Shopee marketing team. 

Once approved, brands can begin recruiting Shopee influencers to promote their products. 

### Recruiting Shopee Influencers

Finding Shopee influencers is as easy as searching on social media platforms. 

Brazilians are particularly active on platforms like TikTok and Instagram. To recruit Shopee influencers, brands can search these platforms using hashtags like #ShopeeInfluencer and #ShopeeInfluencerBR. Shopee influencers have accounts dedicated to Shopee products, including their unique links, and regularly post product reviews.

Brands can reach out to Shopee influencers through direct message or email to discuss a partnership. 

Once a deal is made, brands can expect the influencer to review their products and post promotional content. Brands can also share promotional material for influencers to post, including product images and brand logos. 

### Shopee Brazil’s TikTok Ads

Although Shopee Brazil’s influencer program is robust, partnerships are not your only option. 

In July 2023, Shopee Brazil launched its TikTok Ads program, allowing brands to directly run TikTok Ads through Shopee. 

TikTok ads are a powerful way to reach Brazilian consumers. According to a 2023 report by Kantar, TikTok is the most influential social media platform in Brazil. 

Roughly 73% of Brazilian TikTok users say they have bought something after seeing it in an ad, while 68% have purchased something after seeing it in regular posts. 

Brands looking to reach millions of Brazilian customers can run ads on TikTok through Shopee Brazil’s program. 

## Payment Solutions for Shopee Brazil Purchases

As Indian brands explore Shopee Brazil, they will need to consider how to collect payments. 

Brazil uses the Brazilian real (BRL), and brands will need a way to accept payment in that currency. 

Fortunately, Shopee Brazil supports multiple payment solutions to facilitate purchases, including:

- **Credit Card**: Shopee Brazil accepts major credit cards, including Visa, Mastercard, Diners Club, and Elo. Brands can work with their banks to accept credit card payments in Brazilian Real.
- **Online Bank Transfer**: Shopee Brazil accepts bank transfers from several local banks. 
- **Boleto Bancário**: Boleto Bancário is a popular payment method in Brazil, allowing customers to pay bills at banks and ATMs. Shopee Brazil accepts this payment method. 

## Conclusion

As Shopee’s popularity grows in Brazil, the opportunities for Indian brands to expand their audience through influencer partnerships also grows. With a robust influencer network and effective advertising options, Shopee Brazil is paving the way for brands to tap into the Brazilian eCommerce wave.
