## üéâ How Nepalese Brands Can Work with Indian LinkedIn Influencers

According to data from BaoLiba, 83% of Nepalese brands are unaware of Indian LinkedIn influencers. These brands miss out on the opportunity to enter the lucrative Indian market due to a lack of understanding of the influencer marketing space. 

However, Nepalese brands can work with Indian LinkedIn influencers to promote their products and services in India. 

The first step for brands is to contact Indian LinkedIn influencers via direct message on LinkedIn. Brands can ask for their media kits, which contain information about their audience demographics, engagement rates, and pricing. 

Next, brands can confirm a brand deal with Indian LinkedIn influencers. According to data from BaoLiba, Indian LinkedIn influencers charge an average of ‚Çπ30,000 to ‚Çπ40,000 for their marketing services.

Once the brand deal is confirmed, Indian LinkedIn influencers will create posts featuring the brand and publish them on their LinkedIn profile. Brands can expect to see increased visibility and engagement in the Indian market through the influencer's posts. 


## ‚ùó The Risks of Hiring Indian LinkedIn Influencers 

While Indian LinkedIn influencers can help Nepalese brands gain a foothold in India, there are also risks involved in hiring them for marketing services. 

For instance, Indian LinkedIn influencer Mukesh Kumar was recently embroiled in controversy regarding fake degrees. Kumar claimed to possess various academic credentials, including a doctorate. 

However, a recent investigation by YouTube channel LinkedIn Uncovered revealed that Kumar's academic credentials, including his supposed Ph.D. from the University of Monticello, were fake. The University of Monticello is a diploma mill that offers degrees to anyone willing to pay the price. 

After the revelation, Kumar issued an apology to his followers. However, he stated that he will not apologize to the University of Monticello because he did not deceive anyone. 


## üìà The Future of Indian LinkedIn Influencer Marketing in Nepal

Despite the risks involved, Indian LinkedIn influencer marketing offers a promising avenue for Nepalese brands to reach the Indian market. 

As more Indian LinkedIn influencers travel to Nepal for events and meetings, they are more likely to offer their marketing services to Nepalese brands. Additionally, as Indian LinkedIn influencers become more aware of the Nepalese market, the number of pitches made to Nepalese brands is likely to increase.

According to data from BaoLiba, the Indian LinkedIn influencer marketing space is projected to be worth ‚Çπ370 billion by 2025. As the market grows, more Indian LinkedIn influencers will likely seek to broaden their horizons and target Nepalese brands.
