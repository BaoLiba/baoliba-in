In online content creation, India is one of the leading contributors, especially in the area of social media influence. 

According to data compiled by stats website Statista, Indian influencers account for nearly 30% of global influencer traffic on leading social media platforms.  

This is the highest figure from any country in the world, well ahead of the USA, which has just above 16% of the overall pie. 

Indian influencers are not only prolific at home, but they are also active abroad as well. Germany is one of the countries that Indian influencers target, particularly those who specialize in Twitter.

In Germany, influencers tend to have a more specific focus area compared to India. The classical themes of food, fashion, travel, and music are still valid in Germany. But in addition to that, they have a wide range of niches from fitness and e-sports to motoring and personal finance.

Consequently, Indian Twitter influencers are picking these uncharted niches to target brand deals in Germany. If you are someone who writes about finance and are an active Twitter influencer in India, then you should consider Germany as your next destination for brand deals. 

### üá©üá™ Why Germany?

So why are Indian Twitter influencers targeting Germany for brand deals? 

The reason is simple; it is about where the money is! 

German brands are willing to pay some serious cash for a single brand endorsement on Twitter. An influencer friendly agency in India told us that Indian Twitter influencers who secure a brand deal in Germany do not only get once-off payments. 

Most German brands offer brand deals that are structured to cover a longer period, with relatively higher payments for a single post compared to local brand deals. 

A Twitter influencer from India has an approximate rate of about ‚Çπ4000 (48 Euros) for a single brand deal. In Germany, the same influencer can charge about ‚Çπ30,000 (360 Euros) to a German brand.

That is a whopping difference of ‚Çπ26,000 for a single brand deal! 

### üèôÔ∏è How To Secure Brand Deals?

Now that you know why German brand deals are lucrative, the next question that comes to mind is how to actually secure a brand deal in Germany? 

For starters, it is not as simple as sending out a few tweets in German. This is not how you connect your target audience to a German brand. 

Consider the example of a Nagpur based Twitter influencer who has secured several brand deals in Germany. 

According to this influencer, the biggest hurdle is language. The influencer says that only about 5% of the German population are fluent in English compared to about 50% of Indian citizens.

This language gap presents a unique challenge for Indian Twitter influencers in Germany. 

So the first tip is to ensure you have a comprehensive understanding of the German language. 

Even if you do not speak fluent German, you need to be able to express yourself in the German language. If you struggle with learning languages, then you may need to hire a German language tutor who can help you overcome this challenge. 

Once you have the language down, it is time to get into the specifics. 

### üèõÔ∏è Specifics That Work

According to an influencer industry expert based in India, German audiences tend to gravitate towards authenticity in their brands. 

So if you are someone who specializes in fake news or satire, Germany is not your target. Conversely, if you are an influencer that specializes in niches that promote facts and data-driven content, then you are on the right track. 

For instance, fitness influencers are very popular in Germany. 

If you are an Indian fitness influencer on Twitter, then you need to get your facts right. German audiences prefer their fitness influencers to be factual. 

This means that if you are an influencer that relies on hype for engagement, then you need to revise your content strategy. Hype is not part of the German culture. 

German influencers are also committed to their niches, so if you end up securing a brand deal with a particular German brand, stick with that brand throughout the duration of the contract.

Some Indian influencers make the mistake of jumping ship to promote rival brands while they are still in the middle of a contract. This is not good practice and could end up with your contract being terminated. 

### ü§ù Authenticity Over The Top

In the world of social media influence, authenticity is the name of the game. This is true across all social media platforms and across all markets. 

But when it comes to Twitter brand deals in Germany, authenticity is over the top. 

Unlike other social media platforms where the influencer is given a leeway to exaggerate their experiences with a brand, Twitter influencers in Germany don't have that luxury. 

For instance, if you are a food influencer in India, you can hype up a German beer brand on Twitter by portraying it as the best tasting beer in the world. 

This is an exaggeration, but it is allowed for brand endorsements on Twitter in India. This is not the case for Germany. 

According to our influencer contact in Germany, if a brand is making a particular claim, that claim has to be substantiated with evidence. This means that if a Twitter influencer endorses a German beer brand as the best tasting beer in the world, then that claim must be backed up with data. 

In the example of the Indian food influencer, they would have to produce results of taste tests that have been conducted in accordance with scientific protocols to substantiate the claim.

### üìà Metrics Matter

When it comes to metrics, numbers matter a lot in Germany. 

According to an influencer agency in India that specializes in Germany, German data-driven audiences prefer to see metrics in social media influence. 

This means that if you are trying to secure a Twitter brand deal with a German tech company that produces wireless headphones, metrics are important. 

The audience will want to know how many hours of audio they can get out of a single charge with the headphones. 

As a Twitter influencer, you will need to have that metric on hand if you want to attract that brand deal. 

Furthermore, you will also need to showcase metrics from your own influence. For instance, how many hours do your followers spend on your profile in a single day? 

Most social media influencers have access to metrics and statistics about their influence. The Twitter influencer who works in wireless tech would need to showcase their metrics that relate to average engagement rates and average traffic from link clicks.

### üìÖ Timing Is Key

Timing is key to securing brand deals for Twitter influencers targeting Germany. 

The German audience is not only particular about the type of content they consume, but they are also very particular about when they consume it. 

According to stats website Hootsuite, the best times to post on Twitter in Germany are between 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM on weekdays. 

German audiences also prefer their Twitter content to be published at the beginning of the week, which is Monday, or later in the week on Thursday. 

Fridays are a bit of a mixed bag. Some German audiences prefer their Twitter content to be posted on Friday mornings, while others prefer it later in the day. 

So if you are looking to secure a brand deal with a German brand, make sure that you post your content during the specified times. 

### üí≥ Payment Methods

When it comes to payments for Twitter brand deals in Germany, expect to receive your payment via bank transfer. 

According to various sources, bank transfer is the most popular payment method for online influencers in Germany. 

So if you are expecting payments via cryptocurrency or other methods, you may be in for a rude awakening. 

In India, influencers are accustomed to receiving payments via third party payment methods such as Google Pay or PayPal. However, only bank transfers are guaranteed when it comes to Twitter brand deals with German brands. 

### ü§î Bottomline

Brand deals may seem like a distant goal for Indian Twitter influencers, but they are achievable with the right tactics.
