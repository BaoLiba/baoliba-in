As the world's largest professional network, LinkedIn has become an increasingly popular platform for influencers to promote brands and engage with their audiences. India is home to some of the most effective influencers on LinkedIn, and many of them are exploring opportunities to work with brands in Europe, especially Germany. In a recent report, India's top LinkedIn influencers shared their strategies for securing brand deals in Germany.



## üí° Why Germany?

There are several reasons why India-based LinkedIn influencers are interested in securing brand deals in Germany.

Firstly, Germany is the largest economy in Europe and one of the wealthiest countries in the world. This means that there are a larger number of brands looking to promote their products and services in Germany than in other European countries.

Secondly, Germany has a booming startup scene, with many innovative companies looking to break into international markets. This means that they are more open to working with influencers who can help them reach a wider audience.

Finally, Germany has a strong commitment to fair play and quality in marketing communications. This means that influencers who work with brands in Germany can be confident that they are promoting products and services that meet high standards.


## üé§ How Do Indian LinkedIn Influencers Secure Brand Deals in Germany?

According to India's top LinkedIn influencers, the key to securing brand deals in Germany is to demonstrate an understanding of the German market and to use LinkedIn's advanced targeting options to reach potential clients.

Madhur Gupta, a LinkedIn influencer and founder of the startup consultancy firm, Dealing with Startups, says that he has secured several brand deals with German companies by creating content that resonates with the German audience.

"I use LinkedIn's analytics tools to track the engagement of my posts. This helps me understand what type of content my German audience is interested in and allows me to create more of it," says Gupta.

"I also use LinkedIn's advanced targeting options to reach potential clients in Germany. For example, I can target my posts to specific industries, such as technology or finance, and to specific job titles, such as CEO or marketing manager. This means that my posts are more likely to be seen by decision-makers who are interested in working with influencers."

Ankur Warikoo, a serial entrepreneur and LinkedIn influencer with over 9 million followers, says that he also uses LinkedIn's advanced targeting options to secure brand deals in Germany.

"I use LinkedIn's advanced targeting options to reach potential clients in Germany. For example, I can target my posts to specific industries, such as technology or finance, and to specific job titles, such as CEO or marketing manager. This means that my posts are more likely to be seen by decision-makers who are interested in working with influencers," says Warikoo.

He also advises Indian influencers to speak German. "Learning German will help you communicate better with potential clients in Germany and show that you are serious about working with them."

### üí° Use Local Platforms to Secure Brand Deals

In addition to using LinkedIn's advanced targeting options, many Indian LinkedIn influencers also use local platforms to secure brand deals in Germany.

For example, Indian LinkedIn influencer Mandeep Singh has secured several brand deals with German companies by using the local influencer marketing platform, Tribu. 

"I joined Tribu because it's a platform that connects brands with influencers in Germany. By joining Tribu, I was able to connect with several German companies that were looking for influencers to promote their products and services. I secured several brand deals through Tribu, and I still work with them today," says Singh.

### üí∏ How Do Indian LinkedIn Influencers Get Paid?

When working with brands in Germany, Indian LinkedIn influencers typically get paid in euros. However, there are some exceptions.

For example, Ankur Warikoo says that he prefers to get paid in cryptocurrencies when working with brands in Germany. 

"I prefer to get paid in cryptocurrencies because it allows me to avoid the high fees charged by banks for international wire transfers. It also allows me to access my funds more quickly and easily," says Warikoo.

Other payment methods that are commonly used by Indian LinkedIn influencers when working with brands in Germany include PayPal and TransferWise.

## üìä The Future of LinkedIn Influencers in Germany

According to a recent report by Influencer Marketing Hub, the number of brands that are looking to work with influencers on LinkedIn is expected to increase significantly in the coming years. 

This means that there will be more opportunities for Indian LinkedIn influencers to secure brand deals in Germany and other European countries.

As India's top LinkedIn influencers continue to demonstrate their effectiveness in promoting brands, it is likely that we will see even more Indian influencers making waves in Germany and beyond.

## ‚ùó The Challenges of Working with Brands in Germany

Despite the many opportunities that exist for Indian LinkedIn influencers to secure brand deals in Germany, there are also some challenges that they must be aware of.

One of the biggest challenges is the cultural differences between India and Germany. For example, Germans are known for their directness and candidness. This means that they may be more likely to provide constructive criticism of an influencer's work than clients in other countries.

Indian LinkedIn influencer Mandeep Singh says that this directness can sometimes be misinterpreted as rudeness. "Germans are more direct in their communication than we are used to in India. This means that they may say things that we interpret as being rude when they are actually just being direct," says Singh.

Another challenge is that influencers in Germany are subject to stricter regulations than those in India. For example, the German Advertising Standards Authority has strict guidelines on the use of influencers in marketing communications. This means that influencers in Germany must disclose any paid partnerships and must not make false or misleading claims about the products and services that they promote.

Indian LinkedIn influencer and marketing consultant, Dheeraj Mehrotra, says that it is important for Indian influencers to understand these regulations before working with brands in Germany.

"Influencers in Germany are subject to stricter regulations than those in India. This means that Indian influencers must be aware of these regulations before working with brands in Germany. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in penalties for both the influencer and the brand," says Mehrotra.
