Gone are the days when Indian influencers relied solely on domestic markets for brand collaborations. With the rise of platforms like Moj, influencers are now seizing opportunities beyond India's borders. 

French brands aiming to expand their reach and connect with Indian audiences are now partnering with Indian influencers on Moj. 

In this article, we'll explore how Indian influencers on Moj are securing brand deals with French companies, the tactics they use, and what it means for the future of international influencer marketing.

### üèÅ What is Moj?

Moj is a short-form video application created in India by Noida-based tech company ShareChat.

Launched in November 2020, Moj was born out of the need for Indian consumers to have a domestic alternative to TikTok.

Over the course of just three years, Moj has accumulated over 300 million downloads and is now the second most downloaded app in India.

Moj influencers have capitalized on the platform's popularity, rising from the depths of obscurity to command large followings. 

The app's diverse user base, which is predominantly under 20 years old, has made it an attractive platform for brands looking to target Indian youth. 

Moj influencers have become highly sought-after marketing assets for brands looking to connect with the younger generation in India.

### üá´üá∑ Why are French brands interested in Indian influencers?

In recent years, France has become one of the top destinations for Indian tourists. 

In 2022, over 30,000 Indian tourists visited Paris, an increase of 77% compared to 2021. 

This increasing interest from Indian nationals has made French brands aware of the country's growing importance as an overseas market. 

Brands in France are now scrambling to capture this wave of Indian tourists by wooing them with marketing strategies that will appeal to their tastes and preferences.

For French brands that want to connect with Indian nationals outside of India, partnering with Indian influencers provides a level of authenticity that resonates with Indian audiences.

Indian influencers on Moj, who are targeting audiences in India, have the expertise and knowledge to create messaging and campaigns that are culturally relevant. 

This gives them an advantage over French influencers who may not understand the uniqueness of Indian culture and how best to market products and brands to Indian audiences.

### üìà How Indian Moj influencers are securing brand deals with French companies?

Indian influencers on Moj are now adopting strategies employed by influencers in other parts of the world to secure brand deals with French companies.

While many traditional methods are still in play, Indian influencers on Moj are aware of new trends that are making a mark in influencer marketing, and they are tapping into this knowledge to secure lucrative partnerships with French brands.

#### üîç Being present in the right places

When it comes to securing brand deals, being in the right place at the right time is crucial. 

Whether it‚Äôs a physical location or a virtual one, influencers need to be where brands are looking if they want to be discovered.  

This is why Indian influencers on Moj are getting savvy about being visible in various online spaces where French brands are searching for marketing talent. 

Many French brands are not only searching for Indian influencers to partner with on Moj, but they are actually looking for them in popular business and marketing spaces on platforms like LinkedIn. 

Indian influencers on Moj are optimizing their LinkedIn profiles to attract the attention of French brands that want to partner with them. 

They are doing this by listing their work on Moj as a skill and then showcasing high-performing content that they have produced on the platform. 

Through this, they are showing brands exactly what they can do and how their work can help those brands achieve their marketing goals.

By optimizing their LinkedIn profiles to attract potential partners, Indian influencers on Moj are now occupying an important online space that can lead to lucrative brand deals.

#### üí¨ Leveraging social media connections

When it comes to securing brand deals, having the right connections can fast-track the process. 

This is why Indian influencers on Moj are reaching out to other influencers across various social media platforms. 

While it may seem that influencers are in competition with each other, the reality is that many of them consider other influencers to be their allies, as they often rely on one another for support and referrals. 

Many influencers have a tight-knit community where they share tips, strategies, and even referrals. 

If one influencer cannot take on a brand deal due to a scheduling conflict, they can refer another influencer to that brand instead. 

This is a common practice that Indian influencers on Moj are tapping into to refer each other for brand deals with French companies.

For example, a popular Moj influencer may not have the necessary market reach to land a brand deal, but they may know of another influencer who does. 

The popular influencer can then refer the other influencer to the brand, allowing them to take the lead on the partnership, which they would have otherwise not gotten if not for the referral. 

This is how Indian influencers on Moj are forging brand deals with French companies. 

#### üíª Targeting brands directly through email

Being discovered by brands looking to partner with influencers can be a long and arduous process. 

That‚Äôs why many influencers do not leave their fortunes to chance. They take matters into their own hands and start reaching out to brands themselves.

Influencers have been known to reach out to brands directly via email in their efforts to secure partnerships. 

This is also a strategy that Indian influencers on Moj have employed to forge brand deals with French companies. 

Some influencers have even created dedicated email addresses for this specific purpose. 

They are sending out emails to companies in France touting their services as influencer marketers and encouraging brands to work with them.

To enhance their chances of getting a response, influencers are creating engaging and catchy subject lines. 

The content of their emails often contains links to their profiles on Moj, allowing brands to check them out and see if they are a good fit for their products and services.

#### ü§ù Working with influencer marketing agencies

While many influencers have successfully forged their own brand deals, they are still overwhelmed by the prospect of having to do everything themselves. 

This is where influencer marketing agencies come in. 

Agencies take on the burden of finding brands for influencers to partner with so that they can focus on creating high-quality content. 

Indian influencers on Moj have also engaged with influencer marketing agencies to help them connect with French companies that want to work with them.

These agencies have a wide range of resources at their disposal that they leverage to find brand partnerships for their clients. 

One of the biggest advantages of working with an agency is that they have established relationships with brands. 

This allows them to bypass the lengthy process of negotiation, which can take a lot of time. 

### üìä Will influencer marketing continue to grow in France?

Brands in France are increasingly aware that influencer marketing is one of the most effective ways to reach customers today. 

According to a survey conducted by HubSpot, 75% of marketers in France have reported that influencer marketing helps them achieve their marketing goals.

The 2023 French State of Marketing Report found that the top three goals of marketers in France using influencer marketing are to raise brand awareness, improve brand perception, and reach a wider audience. 

As brands in France continue to realize the effectiveness of influencer marketing, many of them will be looking to Indian Moj influencers to help them connect with audiences back in India. 

### ‚ùó What challenges do Indian Moj influencers face when securing brand deals in France?

Despite the various strategies that Indian Moj influencers are using to forge brand partnerships with French companies, they still face challenges that threaten to derail their efforts. 

Here are some challenges they may have to navigate through in their efforts to establish mutually beneficial partnerships with brands in France.

#### üí∏ Currency conversion fees

The costs associated with converting Indian Rupees (INR) to Euros (EUR) can cut into the profits that Indian influencers make from brand deals in France. 

Indian influencers will need to ensure that whatever payment method they choose, they use one that provides the most favorable conversion rates and also charges the least amount of fees for doing so.

#### üåê Language barriers

Although English is widely spoken in France, many brands may have their promotional content created in French, making it a challenge for Indian influencers to communicate any issues or concerns effectively. 

To navigate this challenge, Indian influencers will need to ensure that they have a good grasp of French or have a fluent French speaker on their team who can handle communications with brands.

#### üì± Social media regulations

In France, influencers engaging in marketing activities must comply with strict regulations set by the French Consumer Code. 

This includes clearly labeling sponsored content, avoiding misleading claims, and following advertising standards. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in fines and damage to an influencer's reputation.  

Indian influencers have to ensure that they stay informed about the laws surrounding social media marketing in France so that they do not run afoul of the law.

### üîö Conclusion

The rise of Indian influencers on Moj has opened the door for international brand partnerships like never before. 

As the demand for authentic marketing continues to grow, we can expect to see Indian Moj influencers become increasingly sought-after assets for brands looking to connect with audiences in India.
