According to data, the average cost of a Twitter influencer marketing collaboration in Vietnam is around 42 USD per post. 

For local brands, the number is slightly higher at 44.5 USD indicating that the influencers are more excited to promote domestic brands than foreign brands.

When it comes to pricing for different sponsorship activities, Vietnam Twitter influencers will charge about 60 USD for a brand mention, which can also be seen as a simple shout-out.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal considerations for Twitter influencer marketing in Vietnam

Earlier in 2023, the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism of Vietnam invited the public to comment on a draft of a new law that would regulate influencer and celebrity marketing in the country.

According to the draft, a celebrity or influencer will be responsible for making sure that their endorsements are not misleading or false. This means they must honestly disclose if the post is sponsored or not.

The penalties for lying will be severe. According to the draft, influencers who mislead or deceive the public through their endorsements can be fined between 10 million to 30 million Vietnamese Dong, which is about 420 USD to 1260 USD.

At this point, the impact of the new law is still unclear, though it signifies that there‚Äôs a robust influencer marketing framework that is going to be enforced.

## üìÖ Future predictions for Twitter influencer pricing in Vietnam

An in-depth market research report conducted by Statista predicts the influencer marketing industry in Vietnam will grow from 3.59 billion USD to 4.06 billion USD in 2025.

A report published by Youtube indicates 4 in 10 Vietnamese consumers use social media for product discovery and that nearly 60% of consumers have purchased a product they saw on a social platform.

The growth of the influencer market will push prices for collaborations upwards, plus Twitter influencers in Vietnam are likely to charge even more due to the predicted growth of Twitter users in the country.

As of January 2023, there were around 2.4 million Twitter users in Vietnam, but the number is expected to increase by another 10% in 2025 based on current social media trends.

Considering all of these factors, it‚Äôs safe to say that Vietnamese Twitter influencer marketing collaborations will be more expensive by 2025. 

If you are a brand targeting the Vietnam market, it‚Äôs best to prepare a bigger budget for influencer marketing and be ready for the price hikes. 

Overall, Twitter influencer collaborations in Vietnam can generate phenomenal ROI so brands should be willing to invest in these partnerships.
