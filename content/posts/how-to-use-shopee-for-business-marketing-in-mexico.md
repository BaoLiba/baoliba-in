Shopee is a force to reckon with in Mexico, and Indian marketers and influencers must pay attention. 

Unlike Indian social media platforms, Shopee is primarily a shopping app, and it is vital for Indian influencers and brands to dive deep into the workings of Shopee. 

From Shopee's algorithm to its ranking system, Indian marketers and influencers should familiarize themselves with the rules of marketing on Shopee, as the platform is distinct from other social media or shopping platforms.

If you want to leverage Shopee for business marketing in Mexico, read to learn from the Indians who‚Äôve already done it. 


# üì¢ Shopee's Algorithm is Not Your Friend

It‚Äôs easy to get lost in the sea of products on Shopee compared to the larger social media platforms. 

Shopee's algorithm is designed for shoppers, not marketers. It curates the content and products that are shown to users based on their shopping habits. 

This means that influencers and brands are at the mercy of the algorithm when it comes to getting their products seen by potential customers.

To get your product to show up on Shopee, you have to sell products that Mexicans want to buy, not what you want them to buy. 

Shopee won't give you a free pass to market your products just because you have a large following. 


# üí° Leverage Shopee‚Äôs Features

Unlike other platforms, Shopee has unique features that influencers and brands can use to market their products. 

Some of the features include flash sales, Shopee live, and Shopee feed. 

Influencers should use Shopee Live as much as possible, as this is a feature that allows influencers to showcase the products they are selling to customers in real-time. 

With Shopee Live, influencers can engage with their audiences, answer questions, and provide demonstrations of the products they are selling. 

Shopee feed is Shopee‚Äôs version of an Instagram feed, where influencers and brands can post photos and videos of their products. Shopee feed is essential for marketing on Shopee, as it allows influencers and brands to visually showcase their products and engage with potential customers. 

The feed works like other social media feeds, and the more interesting your posts, the more visitors and customers you will attract. 


# üìä Shopee is a Shopping App, Not a Social Media Platform

One of the most important things to keep in mind when marketing on Shopee is that it is a shopping app, not a social media platform. 

Unlike other platforms, Shopee does not prioritize social interaction over shopping. 

This means that influencers and brands need to adopt a different approach when marketing on Shopee compared to other social media platforms. 

For example, influencers should focus on showcasing the products they are selling rather than creating entertaining content. 

While engaging and entertaining content is still important, the primary goal of marketing on Shopee is to drive sales. 

This means that influencers should prioritize showcasing the products they are selling and providing potential customers with the information they need to make a purchase. 


# ‚ùó Don‚Äôt Rely Solely on Influencer Marketing

Shopee is not Instagram, and influencers do not have the same influence on purchase intent as they do on Instagram. 

This is a hard pill to swallow for many influencers, and some marketers may be surprised to hear it, but Shopee is not a social media platform.

And while influencers can help drive traffic to products on Shopee, their reach and impact are limited compared to other social media platforms. 

This means that influencer marketing should be just one part of a larger marketing strategy when using Shopee.

Indian marketers and influencers should not rely solely on influencer marketing to drive sales on Shopee. Instead, they should adopt a multi-channel marketing approach that includes other channels such as paid advertising and social media marketing. 


# üí° Collaborate with Local Influencers

While Indian influencers may have a large following back home, they may not have the same clout in Mexico. 

This means that Indian influencers may not be as effective at driving sales on Shopee in Mexico as local influencers.

Collaborating with local influencers can help boost the credibility and visibility of Indian products on Shopee. 

Local influencers have a better understanding of the local market and can provide valuable insights and feedback on how to make products more appealing to Mexican consumers. 

They can also help promote products to their local audience, driving traffic and sales to Shopee. 


# üìä Optimize Product Listings

Optimizing product listings is crucial for driving sales on Shopee. 

This includes using high-quality images, writing compelling product descriptions, and using relevant keywords in product titles and descriptions. 

Indian marketers and influencers should also ensure that their product listings comply with Shopee's guidelines and policies.

Shopee has strict guidelines and policies that must be followed when creating product listings. Failure to comply with these guidelines can result in product listings being removed or accounts being suspended. 

This can severely impact sales and visibility on the platform, so it is important to ensure that all product listings comply with Shopee's guidelines. 


# ‚ùó Brace for E-Wallet Payment

One of the biggest hurdles facing Indian brands and influencers when marketing on Shopee is payment. 

While Shopee accepts different payment methods, most Mexicans prefer e-wallets. 

This means that Indian brands and influencers may not be able to receive payments easily unless they set up a Mexican e-wallet. 

This adds another layer of complexity to the marketing and sales process. 

It requires Indian brands and influencers to navigate different payment systems, which can be time-consuming and frustrating. 

To avoid payment issues on Shopee, Indian marketers and influencers should consider partnering with a local agency that has experience in the Mexican market. 

Local agencies can help navigate the complexities of the Mexican market, including payment systems, regulations, and cultural differences. 

This can help streamline the marketing and sales process and increase the chances of success on Shopee. 


# üí° Understand Shopee‚Äôs Policies and Regulations

Shoppers on Shopee are protected by Shopee's policies and regulations, and Indian marketers and influencers should familiarize themselves with these policies and regulations to avoid issues and ensure compliance. 

Shopee has strict policies regarding product listings, advertising, and promotions. 

Failure to comply with these policies can result in product listings being removed or accounts being suspended. 

This can severely impact sales and visibility on the platform, so it is important to ensure that all marketing efforts comply with Shopee's policies and regulations. 

Additionally, Indian marketers and influencers should also familiarize themselves with Mexican laws and regulations regarding e-commerce and advertising. 

This includes understanding consumer protection laws, advertising regulations, and tax obligations. 


# üìä The Future is Bright for Shopee in Mexico

Despite the challenges of marketing on Shopee in Mexico, the future is bright for the platform. 

According to a report by Statista, the revenue of Shopee Mexico is projected to reach $1.76 billion by 2025. 

This represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.71% from 2023 to 2025. 

As Shopee continues to grow in Mexico and attract more customers, there will be more opportunities for Indian brands and influencers to leverage the platform for marketing and sales. 

However, it is important to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and developments in the Mexican market to remain competitive and maximize success on Shopee. 

This includes keeping an eye on emerging e-commerce trends, changes in consumer behavior, and updates to Shopee's policies and regulations. 

By staying informed and adapting to the changing landscape, Indian marketers and influencers can position themselves for success on Shopee in Mexico.
