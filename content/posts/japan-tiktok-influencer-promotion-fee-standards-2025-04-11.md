When it comes to influencer marketing in Japan, brands can find substantial potential in the largest social media platform in the country, TikTok.


While the average cost of a TikTok influencer collaboration in Japan has become a commonplace inquiry among marketers, the untapped pricing landscape that exists among TikTok influencers in Japan has led many to wonder how much they should factor into their overall budget.


In this article, we delve deep into the current pricing of TikTok influencers in Japan, along with tips on how brands can ensure that they are getting the most effective and immediate return possible with their investment. 


### üí¥ Factors That Affect TikTok Influencer Pricing in Japan


Before looking at the average cost of a TikTok influencer in Japan, brands should first consider the variety of factors that affect pricing.


While the following factors apply to all influencers regardless of platform, they will often impact TikTok influencers even more heavily than those on other platforms.


#### 1. Follower Count


Though follower count can be an important metric in assessing the potential effectiveness of an influencer, it is equally important for brands to understand the relationship between follower count and pricing.


Because TikTok is not the only platform that many influencers may use, brands must understand that an influencer with a large following may not charge nearly as much as they would on another platform if they only have a small following on TikTok.


According to statistics from 2023, the average cost of a TikTok influencer collaboration in Japan across the board is around $575, but this figure can vary substantially based on the follower count of the influencers involved.


For example, an influencer with 100K followers would typically cost around $600 to collaborate with, while an influencer with 500K followers would cost around $990.


#### 2. Engagement Rate


Another highly important metric that can drastically affect the pricing of TikTok influencers in Japan is engagement rate.


TikTok influencers with a smaller following but a much higher engagement rate may charge a similar amount or even more than influencers with a larger following but lower engagement rates.


In fact, brands should prioritize engagement rates when selecting TikTok influencers they would like to collaborate with, even more so than follower count.


It is common knowledge that a smaller group of highly engaged followers is often more effective for brands to leverage than a much larger group of followers who have little to no engagement.


This is especially true on TikTok, where the TikTok algorithm allows posts to go viral irrespective of followers.


#### 3. Content Type


Different TikTok influencers will charge differently based on the type of content they create.


For example, an influencer that specializes in dances may charge differently than an influencer that creates comedy skits.


Also, influencers that create user-generated content (UGC) may charge differently than influencers that promote posts directly.


Brands should consider the type of content that would be optimal for their marketing initiatives. A UGC influencer may be more effective for creating product hype, while a comedy influencer may be effective for product awareness.


#### 4. Inclusivity of Pricing


TikTok influencer pricing can also differ based on what is included in the price.


For example, one influencer may charge a flat fee for just the post, while another may include a multitude of perks and services for the same flat fee, such as multiple posts, reposting to other social media platforms, TikTok ads, and more.


These inclusions may seem like a nice bonus, but brands must be cautious not to get distracted by them. Sometimes it‚Äôs better for brands to pay less and get only what they need for their marketing initiatives.


### üí° Pricing of TikTok Influencers in Japan by Follower Count


As indicated earlier, the average cost of a TikTok influencer collaboration in Japan is around $575, and several factors can affect this price range.


As for a clear perspective of the actual pricing of TikTok influencers in Japan, the following table outlines the average price of TikTok influencers by follower count:


| **Follower Count** | **Average Cost** |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| 10K - 50K           | $200              |
| 50K - 100K          | $600              |
| 100K - 200K         | $800              |
| 200K - 500K         | $990              |
| 500K +              | $1,800            |


With this detailed breakdown, brands should also keep in mind that different influencers with similar follower counts may have different average pricing.


### üì¢ Types of TikTok Influencer Collaborations in Japan


Now that we have established the pricing landscape and metrics that affect pricing, let‚Äôs look at the different types of TikTok influencer collaborations that can occur.


Many brands may be unfamiliar with the ways that influencers can collaborate with brands. The following are the most common types of TikTok influencer collaborations that brands can expect to find when conducting outreach.


#### 1. Video Post


The most common type of TikTok influencer collaboration is a video post. This usually involves an influencer creating a TikTok post that features the brand‚Äôs product or service.


Video posts may involve anything from unboxing and reviews to testimonials and tutorials. Because of the creativity available for TikTok posts, brands should consider what type of video post would be best for their marketing initiatives.


#### 2. Live Stream


Another popular type of TikTok influencer collaboration is a live stream. This usually involves an influencer conducting a live stream that features the brand‚Äôs product or service.


Live streams can be very effective for brand initiatives. Influencers can engage directly with the audience while showcasing a product or service in a more personal way.


This type of collaboration can involve anything from Q&As to performances to giveaways, and more.


#### 3. Blog Write-Up


Though TikTok influencers are primarily known for their videos, they may also offer blog write-ups as a part of their collaboration services.


Blog write-ups may be an important complement to the video content that influencers create. Blog write-ups can contain more detailed information that may help aid conversions.


Brands should consider working with influencers that create articles in addition to posts on TikTok, as there are many benefits to this approach.


#### 4. Story/Highlight


Instagram Stories is another avenue that influencers can use to further promote a collaboration with a brand, and influencers may offer Instagram stories and highlights as part of their collaboration services.


Story/highlights are another great way for brands to gain additional exposure and engagement with their products and services.


Although Stories can only be viewed for a limited time, they can provide a more personal connection with audiences and can drive immediate actions and purchases.


### üìä Pricing of TikTok Influencer Collaborations in Japan by Type


Now that we have established the four most common types of TikTok influencer collaborations, let‚Äôs take a look at the average pricing of TikTok influencer collaborations by type.


The following table outlines some average pricing for TikTok influencer collaborations in Japan:


| **Collaboration Type**  | **Average Cost** |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Video Post               | $575              |
| Video Post + Stories     | $1,000            |
| Video Post + Stories + Blog Write-Up | $1,300 |
| Video Post + Stories + Blog Write-Up + Live Stream | $1,800 |


As indicated, a TikTok influencer collaboration price will naturally vary based on the type of collaboration.


### ‚ùó Payment Methods Available for TikTok Influencer Collaborations in Japan


Generally speaking, brands should also recognize that payment methods will differ from influencer to influencer.


While some influencers may accept payment through all standard payment methods, including checks, bank transfers, credit cards, and more, others may only accept certain payment methods.


Additionally, some influencers may request full payment upfront, while others may request part of the payment upfront and part of the payment after the content is delivered.


Typically, the payment methods that influencers will accept will be outlined in their collaboration terms, but brands should also feel free to inquire about the payment methods directly.


### üíª Best Practices for Effective TikTok Influencer Collaborations in Japan


While working with TikTok influencers is a great way to gain immediate exposure and reach potential customers, brands should also be careful to avoid missed opportunities.


The following best practices can help brands get the most effective bang for their buck when working with TikTok influencers in Japan:


1. **Be Clear About Goals**


Brands should be clear about their goals for the collaboration. Otherwise, influencers may create content that doesn‚Äôt align with what the brand is trying to accomplish.


2. **Consider Authenticity**


Authenticity is key when it comes to influencer collaborations. Brands should consider influencers that naturally align with their brand values and goals.


3. **Plan Ahead**


Brands should plan ahead to avoid missed opportunities. It typically takes at least a few days to get in touch with an influencer, work out all the details, and have the content created and posted.


4. **Do Not Overlook Promotion**


Be sure to ask the influencer if they will promote the collaboration on other platforms. While TikTok is a great platform, influencers may have a more substantial following on other platforms, which can help maximize exposure.


5. **Create a Dedicated Landing Page**


Brands should consider creating a dedicated landing page for TikTok influencer collaborations. This can help identify where traffic is coming from and aid conversion tracking.


### üëä Conclusion


Ultimately, the average cost of a TikTok influencer collaboration in Japan can vary based on many different factors.


While some influencers may charge more, it could be worth the cost if they have a more engaged audience or reach that aligns more with the brand.


By partnering with the right TikTok influencers and considering the factors mentioned in this article, brands can leverage the power of TikTok influencers to reach a wider customer base and increase conversions.
