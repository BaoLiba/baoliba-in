In a world where influencer marketing is growing rapidly, the methods that Indian influencers are using to secure brand deals in Japan may just surprise you.

A significant number of Indian influencers are now monetizing their Snapchat accounts, and they are doing so with Japanese brands.

According to a report by Influencer Marketing Hub, the influencer marketing industry is set to be worth over ₹225 billion (US$2.8 billion) by the year 2025. A significant portion of this amount will come from brands on Snapchat, which is one of the fastest-growing social media platforms in India.

Japanese brands are now taking notice of the power that Indian Snapchat influencers have on the Indian audience, and they are getting in on the action as a result.

But how have Indian influencers managed to penetrate the lucrative Japanese market?

### 🎎 Japan is the Land of Opportunities for Indian Influencers

With a large population of over 125 million, Japan boasts a highly developed economy and is considered one of the largest in the world.

The country has a high life expectancy rate, and as a result, people spend a lot of money, making them a lucrative consumer base for brands worldwide.

According to a report by Statista, Japan's middle class is expected to grow to 140 million by 2030. These developments have made the country one of the most desirable locations for global brands looking to expand.

Japanese consumers are also some of the most active on social media, with 90% of youths and 75% of adults being regular users.

In fact, according to a report by Internet World Stats, Japan has the largest number of active social media users among G7 countries, standing at over 92 million.

With these developments, it is no surprise that Indian influencers and brands are almost always in Japan.

### 💸 Why Japanese Brands are Hiring Indian Influencers on Snapchat

Japan has a strong economy, and the cost of living there is quite high. Many Japanese brands have a hard time finding influencers that can promote their products without breaking their budget.

According to influencer marketing expert Nisha Gupta, Japanese brands are increasingly looking to Indian influencers because their rates are much lower than local influencers.

"Japanese brands are known to pay high fees to local influencers. They are increasingly looking to Indian influencers because they are much more affordable," said Gupta.

The exploitation of Indian influencers by Japanese brands is also a major reason why many brands are looking for Indian influencers.

A report by The Asahi Shimbun revealed that Japanese brands are using Indian influencers to promote their products in a better light. Many brands are now shipping products to Indian influencers in exchange for a shoutout.

These brands are then reposting these shoutouts on their official handles, thus passing them off as their own. Some Japanese brands are even paying Indian influencers to use their products in their posts.

According to the report, brands are no longer interested in hiring local influencers because they are tired of being exploited. Indian influencers don't have a history of exploiting brands, and this is what attracts them to many Japanese brands.

### 🤳 The Power of Indian Snapchat Influencers

Snapchat is one of the fastest-growing platforms in India, boasting over 200 million users.

According to the Social Media Marketing Industry Report, more marketers view Snapchat as an effective social media marketing platform than any other platform.

In fact, according to a report by Statista, advertisers are expected to spend over ₹225 billion (US$2.8 billion) on Snapchat in India by 2025.

This has made Snapchat one of the most desirable platforms for brands looking to expand their reach. Consequently, many Indian influencers have begun to monetize their Snapchat accounts.

According to influencer marketing agency BaoLiba, one of the reasons Snapchat is so popular among Indian influencers is the platform's strong privacy policies.

"Unlike many other social media platforms, Snapchat users can keep their profiles private. This means that users have to accept requests from people who want to follow them. This feature makes Snapchat a much safer platform for influencers," said a spokesperson for the agency.

Snapchat is also one of the most popular platforms among Japanese youths, with over 50% of users falling in the age group of 18-29.

According to a report by Statista, Snapchat is one of the top social media platforms in Japan, boasting an impressive 14 million users.

The level of engagement on Snapchat in Japan is also one of the highest in the world. According to a report by Business Insider, Snapchat is one of the most widely used platforms in Japan, with users spending an average of over 40 minutes a day on the app.

This shows that Japanese consumers are using Snapchat, and it is clear that they are not just using the app for fun.
