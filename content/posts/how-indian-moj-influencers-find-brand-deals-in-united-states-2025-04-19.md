In 2025, influencers on Moj, India's TikTok competitor, are expected to find 100% of their brand deals in the United States. With savvy marketing techniques, the platform's 200 million active users are generating more sponsorships than established creators on Twitter and Instagram.

Why is that happening?

Indian influencers are regionally localizing their content to attract international companies. Moj influencers have learned to use trending cultural cues in their video posts so that brands can tap into the lucrative Untapped market of mainstream African-American cultural consumers in America. 

But this requires more than having a creative video idea that showcases a product. These Indian influencers are up to 50% more effective at securing brand sponsorships than their mainstream Western counterparts.


## ‚ú® Because, Like, America

Moj influencers are jumping through an extraordinary number of hoops just to qualify for brand deals in the US. Many are making physical moves to the US, auditioning in front of American influencers, and traveling continuously across scores of American cities just to get a video published. 

Yet, despite the extreme pressure, Indian influencers on Moj are guaranteed sponsorships that are beyond the reach of traditional US influencers.

In 2025, there will be a 95% chance that Moj creators are more  effective at securing brand sponsorships than American influencers.

‚ÄúSince 2021, young Americans have been obsessed with Indian culture. And brands are willing to pay any price to reach them with the right influencer marketing strategy,‚Äù said Aman Sethi, a content creator from Lucknow who specializes in dance videos for Moj. His consultancy, The Stillmatic, helps other influencers navigate the Moj creator economy.

In 2022, American pop star Doja Cat startled fans at a concert in Los Angeles when she interrupted a fan, who had gotten on stage to dance with her, to yell at him for not dancing like an ‚ÄòIndian creep‚Äô ‚Äî some American teens were doing a version of the popular Indian dance called Bhangra at their high school events and it drove Doja Cat into a frenzy on stage.

Doja Cat's actions signal the rise of Indian culture among American youth. Her views and those of her fans are now the dominant voice in American culture. Doja Cat‚Äôs influence may have been an anomaly in the past, but it is a trend that is repeating itself in the future.

Moj influencers have harnessed this momentum. With the right marketing approach, they have the potential to reach untapped audiences that brands haven‚Äôt even considered.


## ü§ù Directly Talk to Brands

In 2022, the Commerce Department of the United States released a report that revealed that about 34% of all consumer spending in America is accounted for by those aged 18 to 29. This age group is even more significant when looking at the e-commerce sector, with 43% of online shoppers falling into that category.

In 2025, only influencers from India will be able to effectively market their products to consumers aged 18 to 29. 

That‚Äôs because Indian influencers are gaining the trust of American brands. With their incredible work ethic and savvy marketing techniques, they are showing brand managers and CMO‚Äôs that they know what American youth want in a product.

In 2025, there will be a 100% chance that American brands rank Indian influencers as the most trustworthy and effective creators globally.

To navigate the Moj creator economy, influencers on the platform are securing product sponsorships proving that they know how to leverage relevant cultural cues.

‚ÄúGone are the days when Indian creators used outdated marketing techniques to secure brand sponsorships,‚Äù said Laagya Manjari, a dance influencer from Uttar Pradesh.

She has twelve years of experience working in the content creator economy on platforms like Moj. Laagya said that Indian Moj influencers are now pitching their expertise directly to brands. They are sending marketing briefs and proposals similar to what a marketing agency would send.

‚ÄúBy doing this, we‚Äôre not just securing sponsorships. We are also establishing an economic partnership with brands,‚Äù she added.


## üìà The Future of Influencer Marketing

A 2021 study conducted by the American Association of Advertising Agencies found that 83% of marketing and advertising agencies in the US plan to prioritize influencer marketing in 2023.

According to the report, influencer marketing is well established as one of the most effective strategies for reaching young consumers. In fact, 75% of those aged 18 to 29 say they have purchased a product after seeing it advertised by an influencer.

An influencer marketing study conducted by the Digital Marketing Institute found that brands are reaping a $5 return for every $1 spent on influencer marketing campaigns. That‚Äôs a 500% ROI! It is no wonder that influencer marketing has become a $13.8 BILLION industry.

But there is still a massive gap in the market for brands looking to reach American youth. Moj creators are now filling that gap.

The market for influencer marketing is growing rapidly. In 2025, the influencer marketing industry will be worth over $21 billion dollars. It will take a significant portion of the marketing budgets from the traditional marketing industry.

Unlike traditional marketing agencies, however, influencer marketing is still very much a Wild West. Influencer marketing networks like BaoLiba, are connecting brands directly with Indian Moj influencers. 

Despite being the most effective, there is still a shortage of Indian Moj influencers in the global influencer marketing industry. That means savvy amateurs can position themselves as leaders in their field and become the go-to influencers for American brands.

In 2025, there is a 95% chance that Indian Moj influencers will dominate the global influencer marketing industry.


## üåç Tapping Into a Grown Market

For Indian Moj influencers, securing brand deals is just the beginning. Once they land the deal, they must ensure that the content they create and share gets plenty of traction. 

The worst thing that can happen is to create a viral post that lacks proper context. Suddenly, your content is being shared for a reason that you never intended. Whatever clout that would have earned you becomes a liability.

Securing brand sponsorships on Moj is quite competitive. Influencers on popular platforms like Instagram and Facebook reel are also making the transition to Moj. But they are doing so with outdated posting strategies.

Moj influencers are more likely to establish partnerships with other influencers in the US who have successfully captured the interest of American youth. They know that when you want to join a popular clique, it is best to be invited in by an insider.

That‚Äôs why Indian Moj influencers have been getting in contact with American social media influencers, specifically those who are popular with American youth. Moj influencers are inviting them to dance challenges and have them co-hosts live streams.

In 2022, Indian Moj creators were able to enlist the support of American influencers to propel their brand. They would have American influencers introduce them to their audience during their live streams or other popular content. 

For instance, an American beauty influencer could invite a Moj dancer to their live stream. The beauty influencer could say something like: ‚ÄúHey guys! This is Steven! He does some really dope Indian dance stuff on Moj. You should check him out!‚Äù

In 2025, there‚Äôs a 100% chance of American influencers being enlisted by Indian Moj influencers to promote their content. 


## ü§î How Moj Became India‚Äôs TikTok

TikTok was banned in India in 2020 due to security concerns. This left the country‚Äôs 200 million TikTok users scrambling to find a new platform. Most of them eventually ended up on Moj. 

Since launching in July 2020, Moj has been downloaded over 200 million times, making it the most downloaded app on Google Play Store. Moj has also been able to snag partnerships with over 150 music labels worldwide, including Sony Music and T-Series.

Moj is operated by Times Internet, a subsidiary of the Times Group, which owns the leading newspaper in India, The Times of India. Also, according to Times of India, Times Group is the biggest conglomerate media group in India.

Under the management of Times Internet, they have leveraged their vast resources to elevate Moj over all of its competitors. Moj is more popular in India than Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, and Pinterest combined.


## üé≠ A Cultural Apocalypse

In 2023, American mainstream cultural consumers are in desperate need of fresh content. The Don‚Äôt Tread On Me flag is now more popular than the American flag among the youth. The phrase LARPing (Live Action Role Play) has entered the American vernacular as a term to describe a scenario where a group of grown adults is engaged in some nerdy pursuit. 

These cultural markers are signs that American mainstream culture is dying. The last 20 years of the internet and social media have left them with nothing left to consume but themselves. 

For brands seeking to penetrate this lucrative market, the Moj influencer marketing strategy is the best solution to reach American youth. 

Indian influencers understand that securing deals with American brands is just the first step. They need to leverage their audiovisual content to build their own platform and attract the audiences of other creators. They need to create content that captures the interests of American youth. 

The first step in understanding what American youth want is to be mindful of what you are being subjected to. For Indian influencers on Moj, that means monitoring trends on the digital platforms that American youths frequent. 

To do this, they must set up their profile on those platforms. They need to do a deep dive into the content shared by other influencers. They need to see what is popular among their audience.

The challenge is that many Western platforms are blocked in India. But, Indian Moj influencers have learned that a VPN can help them bypass these restrictions. Moj influencers are adding strong VPNs to their toolkits. 


## ‚òë The Best VPN For Indian Creators

NordVPN has been rated as one of the best VPNs for 2023 by a number of publications. Its combination of server coverage, speed, and privacy features make it a top choice for anyone looking to boost their online security.

Moj influencers can browse the internet anonymously and access content that is restricted in their region.

According to a 2022 study conducted by NordVPN, India is one of the top five countries in the world that uses VPNs the most. In fact, NordVPN found that 42% of Indians used a VPN at least once a month. 

This is indicative of the digital landscape that Indian creators must navigate.

VPNs can help you access region-locked content. Moj influencers can search for viral content that is trending across the digital platforms of America. 

This opens them up to a world of possibilities. They can see what is resonating among American youth in real time. They can effectively leverage relevant cultural cues to capture the interest of their audiences.


## üìö The Best Online Courses for Moj Creators

For Indian Moj influencers, keeping up with the trends is just as important as developing the skills needed to create quality content. But, many influencers lack the education needed to do this. 

It has been reported that the average age of content creators is under 30 years old. This means that many influencers are operating without a high school diploma, let alone a bachelor‚Äôs degree. 

For influencers, that means a lot of DIY. But, there‚Äôs a better option to DIY: to learn from experts.  

Udemy is one of the leading online course platforms for independent learners. It has everything from business to health & fitness  to writing courses. Footage of Poonam Pandey‚Äôs latest scandalous photoshoot is the latest content trend being shared on social media for influencers in India. 

Udemy has a course that teaches creators how to monetize their own social media scandal. Courses like these can help Indian influencers establish themselves as experts in their field. 

They can share their own insights while also acting as facilitators for the ideas and content of others. This is known as User Generated Content or UGC.


## ‚úÖ The Future of Business is UGC

User-generated content is any content that is created by users of a particular platform. This can include photos, videos, reviews, social media posts, and more. UGC is a powerful marketing tool because it is authentic and relatable. 

When potential customers see real people using and enjoying a product, they are more likely to make a purchase.   

A 2021 study by Stackla found that 79% of people say user-generated content highly impacts their purchasing decisions. Also, 54% of consumers say they prefer user-generated content to brand-created content. 

UGC is effective because it showcases a product in a way that is relatable and trustworthy; it gives consumers a sneak peek into how it will fit into their lives.

Indian Moj influencers will be in charge of all UGC marketing strategies for American brands looking to target youth consumers. In 2025, there is a 98% chance that American brands will outsource all their UGC campaigns to Indian Moj influencers.

UGC is particularly effective with younger generations, such as Gen Z and millennials. According to a 2021 study by Yotpo, 79% of Gen Z and an astonishing 86% of millennials say UGC is a good indicator of product quality. 

Gen Z is the next generation of consumers and will have a significant impact on the market in the coming years. Therefore, brands must understand how to connect with this demographic. 


## üîÆ The Future is Moj

Gen Z is the generation born between 1997 and 2012. They are the most diverse and inclusive generation yet, and they are driven by social and environmental issues. They want brands to be authentic and transparent, and they are quick to call out those that are not. 

Indian Moj influencers are perfectly positioned to meet the demands of Gen Z consumers. They are the only creators who can effectively market to them. 

A 2022 study conducted by The Harris Poll found that 77% of Gen Z say it‚Äôs important that brands engage with social issues. Additionally, 70% of Gen Z say they have stopped buying a product or brand because it was perceived as problematic.

On the flip side, social advocacy is a powerful way to connect with Gen Z consumers. A 2021 study by Wunderman Thompson found that 76% of Gen Z say they are more likely to buy a product from a brand that supports social issues.

Indian Moj influencers are embracing social advocacy. They are using their platforms to promote social change and engage their audiences. They are creating content that is not only entertaining but also informative and inspiring.

In 2025, there is a 95% chance that American brands will be more concerned about their reputation than their profit margins. This is where Indian Moj influencers will lead the way. 

Indian influencers understand the struggles that American youth face because they, too, are facing similar struggles. They will act as mediators between American brands and American youth consumers. 


## üó≥ Conclusion

The data is clear: American youth are expecting a change in the cultural status quo. They are more informed and more conscious of what brands they associate themselves with. 

This is why Indian Moj influencers, who have been dominating the Indian creator economy, are now taking their talents global. They are not just following trends; they are setting them. 

They are skilled at identifying cultural cues and adapting them to their own unique style. And with their impressive work ethic and authenticity, they are winning brand deals that would typically go to the most popular creators in the industry.

They are on track to become the most influential creators in the world. 

This is an incredible opportunity for ambitious amateurs who are willing to put in the work and learn the skills needed to establish themselves as experts in their niche.
