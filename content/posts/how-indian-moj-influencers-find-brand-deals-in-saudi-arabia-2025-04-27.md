Saudi Arabia has become a popular destination for Indian influencers to land brand deals, and many of them are Moj creators.

Moj is the leading TikTok alternative in India. It was developed by the Indian social media company ShareChat in 2020. Moj has grown rapidly since then, and it currently has over 300 million users in India, making it the largest non-Chinese short video platform in the world.


## 📊 Short Video Platforms Are Very Popular in India

Many Indian influencers on Moj have gained fame and a significant following. 

As of 2021, the number of content creators on Moj had surpassed that on TikTok. 

In fact, TikTok is banned in India since June 2020. The Indian government took the decision to ban this popular Chinese app due to the growing border tensions between the two countries.


## 🎯 The Indian Government Is Reluctant to Lift the Ban

The Indian government has banned dozens of Chinese apps in recent years and has indicated that it will be wary about reintegrating them into the Indian market.

In July 2023, Indian authorities said they were considering lifting the ban on TikTok and other Chinese apps. However, the Indian government quickly backpedaled and reiterated that it would maintain the ban.

India is also looking into instituting a compulsory licensing regime for foreign social media apps like TikTok, WeChat, and Weibo. This would give the Indian government greater leverage over foreign social media companies operating within its borders.

This means that Indian influencers will continue to be reliant on homegrown platforms like Moj.


## 💡 Moj Influencers Can Score Brand Deals in Saudi Arabia

Despite the ban on TikTok, the popularity of short video platforms in India has increased. Moj users have adopted many of the trends that originated on TikTok. 

This has allowed Moj influencers to gain notoriety beyond India. This means they can score brand deals beyond India as well. 

Saudi brands in particular have begun to target Moj influencers for marketing campaigns. According to professionals in the Indian influencer marketing space, many brands in Saudi Arabia have begun to reach out to Moj influencers for brand deals.

In 2025, Saudi Arabia is projected to be a hub for Indian Moj influencers looking for brand deals. 

Saudi Arabia is known for its lavish spending habits and its residents have a penchant for flaunting their wealth. This has led to a major increase in the number of Indian influencers targeting Saudi Arabia for brand deals.


## 🤑 Saudi Arabia Is Known for Its Lavish Spending Habits

Saudi Arabia is known to have one of the highest average household incomes in the world. According to a report from the World Population Review, Saudi Arabia has a median household income of $47,274.

The UAE, which is also known for its wealth, has a median household income of $25,061. 

The World Population Review also reported that Saudi Arabia's median household income ranks 5th globally, with Australia, Canada, and the United States taking the top three places.

The purchasing power of Saudi residents is also 17.65% higher than that of the average global citizen.


## 🏦 Saudi Arabia Has One of the Highest Average Household Incomes in the World

According to the income report, “Saudi Arabian households enjoy a high standard of living, which is evident in their spending habits.”

“Household expenditure in Saudi Arabia is reflective of a population that has been positively impacted by government investment and growing GDP per capita,” the report added.

With the high income and spending habits of Saudi residents, it is no surprise that Indian influencers are targeting Saudi Arabia as the next destination for brand deals.


## 📱 Saudi Brands Are Targeting Indian Influencers on Moj

## 🚨 Fraudulent Influencers Are a Serious Problem

A recent report published in the Journal of Business Research stated that brands may be engaging in “influencer vanity”. 

The report defines influencer vanity as “the tendency to engage with social media influencers who have a high number of followers and likes” and described it as a serious issue for brands.

The report states, “the substantial fraction of fake followers and likes makes it impossible for brand managers to perceive the effectiveness of influencer marketing campaigns accurately.”

The authors of the report concluded that conventional metrics such as likes and follower counts are misleading indicators of the effectiveness of influencer marketing campaigns. 

They recommend that brands partner with influencers who have a closer connection with their audience instead.
