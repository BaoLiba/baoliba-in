SEO agencies, bloggers, and influencers worldwide use social media platforms to promote products and services. These partnerships lead to increased sales for businesses and income for influencers. 

If you plan to hire a Korean influencer for a marketing campaign, you may want to explore the costs of collaboration on Naver Cafe.

Naver Cafe, unlike other platforms, is a private social network where members with specific interests can mingle and exchange ideas. They can build online communities based on shared hobbies, interests, and occupations. 

Everyone can join Naver Cafe and post, but only verified members can open a Cafe. Naver Cafe focuses on peer-to-peer communication rather than influencer content.


## üìä Naver Cafe influencer collaboration costs

Naver Cafe influencers charge from ‚Ç©200,000 to ‚Ç©3,000,000 for collaborations. But the fees depend on the number of members in the Cafe and its engagement level.


## üí° The pricing structure

1. **Cafes with 0-10,000 members** charge around ‚Ç©400,000 to ‚Ç©600,000 ($300-$450) for a sponsored post.

2. **Cafes with 10,000-100,000 members** charge around ‚Ç©1,500,000 to ‚Ç©2,000,000 ($1,125-$1,500).

3. **Cafes with 100,000-1000,000 members** charge around ‚Ç©2,500,000 to ‚Ç©3,000,000 ($1,875-$2,250).

However, Caf√© members typically have more in common and closer relationships. This means posts may receive more engagement compared to higher follower counts on other platforms.


### üíµ Payment methods

It is crucial to note that Korean influencers often prefer cash when getting paid for their clients‚Äô products and services, unlike foreign influencers who accept PayPal or bank transfers.

Cash transactions are especially common in traditional industries like hair and beauty salons in Korea, and many influencers are still accustomed to this culture.

Therefore, if you plan to pay in cash, you may be required to pay the influencer or their agent the same amount as the advertised fees. When you pay cash, the influencer can pocket more than they would through bank transfers due to hidden fees that come with transferring money.


## üßÅ Cafe influencers are not like others

Naver Cafe influencers provide a different service than influencers who collaborate with brands on Instagram and TikTok. They utilize their audiences to organize events that double as advertisements.

For example, if your brand wants to promote a new dessert, you can hire a Naver Cafe influencer with a cooking Cafe (group) to post about it. 

The influencer can arrange a collaboration event with their Cafe members at a local venue where they will make and eat the desserts. The influencer and attendees will take and share pictures of the event on Naver Cafe and their other social media pages.

Such events allow a brand to get more authentic feedback on their products from influencers and potential customers.
