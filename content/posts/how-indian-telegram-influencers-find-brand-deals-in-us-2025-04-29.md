Indian influencers are increasingly capitalizing on Telegram's privacy features to connect with brands for promotions, and they are paying special attention to American clients.

Telegram has become the go-to platform for Indian influencers looking to establish themselves in the international market. The app's encryption, along with the anonymity it affords, makes it the ideal tool for creating buzz around their controversial and often risqu√© content.

Indian influencers on Telegram are growing rapidly, especially as they now target the United States market for collaborations with foreign brands.


## üí° The Telegram Honchos

Telegram India influencers are a special breed. They can be classified into two broad categories: those who run channels and those who are content creators.

The first group consists of those who set up channels on Telegram that serve as a space for adult content. They do not show their faces and have a large number of subscribers, usually in the hundreds of thousands. Their main source of income is from paid subscriptions. They charge anywhere from INR 200 to INR 8,000 per month, depending on the quality and quantity of content. If they have a free Telegram channel, they also earn from subscription fees to their paid channels.

The second group includes content creators who upload their explicit photos and videos to adult channels, groups, and bots. They earn a commission from the channel or bot owner for every subscriber they bring on board. They are paid in cryptocurrency, which allows them to bypass many of the restrictions imposed by payment processors on adult content. 

Telegram India influencers have been able to penetrate the international market by gaining a foothold in the US. They have a long track record of successfully marketing many Indian brands, but their growth curve is now accelerating as they branch out into American territory.


## üíé The Revenue Model

Adult Telegram channels have become the default choice for Indian influencers to monetize their content. For those who want to own a Telegram channel, it is a relatively easy process. They just have to create a channel, join the social media group, and they‚Äôre halfway there. After that, they just need to promote it on other platforms, such as Instagram, Facebook, and online forums.

Channels that are already established can garner a large number of subscribers in a very short time. For example, one Telegram channel named Onlyfans, which is focused on Indian adult content and that has been active for only 18 months, has already amassed 394,000 subscribers. It has over 200 contributors and features over 800 pieces of original content.

Indian Telegram influencers are very enterprising and know how to make money.

The channel owners utilize a variety of strategies to monetize their channels. For example, they can sell ad space to other Telegram channels that want to promote their paid subscriptions or free channels. They can also sell merchandise or services directly on their channels, such as custom videos, shoutouts, or erotic photos. They can also offer premium subscriptions for exclusive content or early access to new releases.

However, the most lucrative way to monetize a Telegram channel is by taking commissions from the adult services and content they promote. Because Telegram is relatively decentralized, content creators can offer their services directly to viewers without going through intermediaries. The key that opens this gate is Telegram bots. 

A bot on Telegram can be thought of as a program that automates and executes certain functions. Content creators can use Telegram bots to automate processes such as booking appointments, sending notifications, and accepting payments. There are many types of Telegram bots available, but only a few are suitable for the adult industry. The best Telegram bots for adult services allow users to purchase subscriptions or pay-per-view (PPV) content with cryptocurrency.

Different Telegram bots have different features and capabilities, so it is important for influencers and service providers to choose the ones that best suit their needs. They can also create their own bots to have more control and flexibility over their offerings.

There are some adult Telegram bots that are currently popular and widely used in the adult industry. These include:

1. **Sexting Bot:** This bot helps content creators and sex workers automate conversations with clients and fans on Telegram. It can send personalized messages, photos, videos, and links to payment pages. Content creators can use this bot to schedule messages and respond automatically to users who ask for rates or services.

2. **Mature Proxy Bot:** This bot helps adult models promote their Telegram channels and earn money from subscribers. It can generate unique invite links for each user and track their activity. It can also send automatic messages to new subscribers and provide them with access to exclusive content.

3. **Adult Payment Bot:** This bot helps adult content creators accept payments on Telegram without relying on third-party payment processors that may ban or block adult content. It can process payments in cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, or in digital currencies, such as WebMoney or Perfect Money. It can also send automatic notifications when a payment is received.

4. **Cuddle Bot:** This bot helps adult models manage their bookings and appointments on Telegram. It can create a calendar of available slots and allow clients to book sessions directly through the bot. It can also send reminders and notifications to both parties.

With the right strategy and tools, Indian Telegram influencers can earn a full-time income from their channels and services. 


## üõ†Ô∏è The Strategy

To attract American brands, Indian Telegram influencers must have a proper strategy. The first step is to make sure that they have a Telegram channel that is suitable for foreign brands.

For most brands targeting an American audience, the ideal name for a Telegram channel would include the keywords "Telegram" and "OnlyFans." For example, a channel could be named "OnlyFans Telegram Channel," or "Telegram OnlyFans Group." 

Some adult brands go a step further and add "VIP," "TOP," "Best," "Exclusive," or "Premium" to their channel name. 

The next step is to create a profile that is appealing to American brands. Influencers should highlight their expertise, experience, and willingness to partner with international clients. They should also provide accurate descriptions of their services, including the type of adult content they produce.

They should also provide their contact information, such as an email address or chat link, so brands can easily reach them. If they have a website or portfolio, they should include it in their profile as well. 

Telegram influencers can promote their channels on other platforms and forums that allow adult content. However, they should avoid common spammy tactics, such as posting unsolicited messages, flooding groups with links, or using bots to send mass messages. These tactics can get them banned from Telegram or flagged as spam.

Once they have a respectable number of followers, they can begin pitching brands directly or signing up with influencer marketing agencies. Some Telegram influencers even have their own agencies.

Influencers can also participate in influencer marketing platforms that facilitate connections between influencers and brands. These platforms allow influencers to create profiles and showcase their work, making it easier for brands to find and hire them for campaigns. Some popular influencer marketing platforms that also work with Telegram influencers include:

1. **Influencity:** This platform helps brands find, analyze, and manage their influencer marketing campaigns on various social media channels, including Telegram. It offers features such as influencer discovery, audience analysis, campaign tracking, and reporting.

2. **Klear:** This platform provides brands with tools to discover, engage, and measure their influencer marketing efforts across multiple social media platforms, including Telegram. It offers features such as influencer identification, relationship management, campaign monitoring, and analytics.

3. **HypeAuditor:** This platform specializes in providing brands with insights and analytics on influencer marketing across various social media channels, including Telegram. It offers features such as influencer discovery, audience quality analysis, fraud detection, and performance tracking.

4. **Famebit:** This platform is focused on connecting brands with YouTube and Instagram influencers but has recently expanded to include Telegram influencers as well. It allows brands to post campaigns and receive proposals from interested influencers.

5. **Grapevine:** This platform is designed for YouTube and Instagram influencers but also works with Telegram influencers. It allows influencers to join campaigns and earn money by promoting brands on their channels.

6. **Izea:** This platform connects brands with influencers and content creators across various media, including Telegram. It offers features such as influencer discovery, campaign management, and performance tracking.

7. **Twitch:** Twitch is primarily known as a streaming platform, but it also has a large community of influencers who promote various products and services. Brands can connect with Twitch influencers and ask them to promote their Telegram channels.


## üì£ The Potential

The allure of the U.S. market is hard to resist, especially for Indian Telegram influencers. 

While Telegram's overall market share in the U.S. is less than 5%, the potential for expansion is massive. According to Statista, the app has 84 million active users in the U.S. as of 2023 and is expected to grow by 38% by 2025. 

Meanwhile, the adult Telegram space is also growing rapidly. According to the report published by the International Business Times, Telegram's porn channels have overtaken Pornhub as the top platform for adult content, with two-thirds of the app's biggest channels dedicated to sexual content.

According to a report published by the online adult platform Pornhub, Telegram is now the most popular platform for adult content creators and has surpassed traditional pornography sites. 

Telegram accounted for 63% of all adult traffic to the top 100 porn channels in 2022. This is up from 3% in 2021 and 0.1% in 2020.

The share of adult content in Telegram channels is now so high that it is estimated to account for more than half of the app's total users.

Telegram has also recently taken steps to strengthen its ban on adult content, which could further push more adult influencers to seek foreign brands.

In January 2023, Telegram announced that it would ban pornography and sexual services from its platform, with a 30-day grace period for content creators and advertisers to remove such content. The ban will affect all types of sexual content, including photos, videos, links, and messages. Telegram has stated that it will enforce the ban strictly and will not allow any exceptions or loopholes.

According to a spokesperson for Telegram, enforcing the ban is an important step to ensure user safety and satisfaction. "We believe that our users should have the right to enjoy a platform free from unwanted or harmful content," the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson also stated that Telegram is committed to providing a safe and secure environment for all users and will work closely with content creators and advertisers to help them transition to more appropriate content.

Telegram's ban on unwanted sexual content follows a similar move by YouTube last year, which banned all sexually explicit content from its platform. 


## ‚ùó The Risks

Despite the booming market and lucrative opportunities, Indian Telegram influencers must tread carefully as they market to American brands.

First, Telegram is not widely known for its adult content. While there are many adult channels on Telegram, the app itself is not an adult platform like Pornhub or OnlyFans. Telegram has a strict policy against pornography and sexual content, and it does not allow channel owners to post adult content without facing severe consequences.

Telegram's terms of service state that users must not post content that violates any laws or regulations, including those related to obscenity, indecency, or sexually explicit material. Telegram also prohibits users from sending unsolicited messages or spam, which can often include adult content.

Users who violate these policies can have their channels removed or face legal action. Telegram has stated that it will take a zero-tolerance approach to adult content and will remove any channels or users that violate its policies.

For this reason, Telegram influencers should be very careful when promoting their channels to American brands. They should avoid using any terms or phrases that could be considered adult content, even if that is what they are promoting.

Second, many Telegram influencers charging brands in cryptocurrency are violating India's foreign exchange laws.  

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has expressed concerns over the rampant use of cryptocurrencies in microtransactions for social media influencers and sex workers, especially in Telegram channels. 

The growing dependence on cryptocurrency payments for paid subscriptions could lead to increased scrutiny by regulators, said a senior banker who tracks the crypto sector.

According to a document shared on social media, RBI data showed a threefold increase in the number of crypto transactions between 2020 and 2021. 

Bitcoin accounted for 75% of the total crypto traffic, while Ethereum, Tether, Cardano, and Ripple made up the remaining 25%. 

In 2021 alone, 20 million Indians purchased cryptocurrency worth $6.6 billion, with over 90% of transactions originating from Tier I and Tier II cities.

According to the global crypto statistics tracker Changelly, retail transactions account for 94% of crypto traffic in India. 

The RBI document noted that the average transaction size in India is $1,000-$10,000, which is significantly lower than the global average, indicating a larger number of transactions.

The document also said that the crypto traffic generated from India is only 0.1% of the total global crypto traffic, suggesting a huge potential for growth.

The RBI document also warned about the risks associated with crypto transactions, such as fraud, hacking, and volatility. It advised users to be cautious and do their own research before investing in cryptocurrencies.
