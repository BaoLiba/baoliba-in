With Bollywood and Bhangra taking the world by storm, it is only natural for Indian brands looking to expand in the South Korean market to focus their advertising efforts on V LIVE influencers. 


The platform remains as one of the most popular sites for live broadcasts in South Korea with many world-renowned K-Pop idols and popular V-Live stars running personal channels.


With millions tuning in and subscribing to these influential figures, Indian brands will want to join the party while they still can. 


However, unlike other forms of influencer marketing, pricing for V LIVE promotions can be tricky and depend on a number of factors discussed below.


## üìä What Are the Costs of Collaborating with a V LIVE Influencer?

As the South Korean version of Twitch, V LIVE is still popular for live broadcasts even though it is set to be merged with Weverse LIVE in early 2023. 


While the platform can not boast the audience reach of YouTube or Instagram, the exclusive content provided to subscribers means that V LIVE influencers can demand a better compensation than other forms of digital marketing. 


To this end, it is crucial to understand what Indian brands can expect when it comes to pricing V LIVE influencer collaborations.


### üìÖ Pricing Table for V LIVE Influencers in 2025

|  V LIVE Follower Count  |  Average Pricing for Indian Brands  |
|:-----------------------:|:------------------------------------:|
|       0 - 10,000       |      2,000 - 6,000 INR               |
|      10,000 - 20,000   |      5,000 - 11,000 INR              |
|      20,000 - 50,000    |   10,000 - 20,000 INR               |
|      50,000 - 100,000   |   20,000 - 30,000 INR               |
|      100,000 - 200,000  |   30,000 - 50,000 INR               |
|      200,000 - 500,000  |   50,000 - 80,000 INR               |
|         500,000         |   80,000 - 100,000 INR              |
|        1,000,000        |       1,00,000 - 2,00,000 INR       |


### üìà Audience Engagement Affects Pricing

While follower counts can be an attractive feature for V LIVE influencers, audience engagement will have a direct role in pricing. 


In this sense, V LIVE influencers with low follower counts but high engagement can charge similar prices as influencers with a large following but little interaction.


This is especially true for K-Pop idols who dominate the V LIVE scene. 

For example, the fandom of BLACKPINK called BLINK has a long history of giving back to the idols and through donations for charitable causes.

In 2023, fans donated over 40 crores to support various causes rendering the group as one of the top fundraisers in history.


### üí∏ Payment Methods for V LIVE Influencer Collaborations

Unlike regular influencer marketing on Instagram or Facebook, V LIVE influencer promotions will often require Indian brands to pay in South Korean cash, known as the South Korean Won (KRW).


Though there is potential for cross-border payment solutions, be wary of any potential transaction fees when paying South Korean V LIVE influencers by bank transfer.


### ‚ùó Legal Contracts Are Still Required

Even though V LIVE is a newer form of influencer marketing, legal contracts are required to ensure that both parties comply with the agreed terms.

For Indian brands, this could mean additional costs to hire legal professionals to draft and/or approve contracts before agreeing to partner with V LIVE influencers. 


## üí° Conclusion

Using V LIVE influencers remains an attractive option to delve into the South Korean market.

However, it is crucial for Indian brands to understand the pricing strategy in order to get the best bang for their buck.

If done correctly, Indian brands will be able to reap the rewards of the lucrative South Korean market.
