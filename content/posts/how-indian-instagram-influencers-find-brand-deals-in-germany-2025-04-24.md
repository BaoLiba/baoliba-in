Since the world is going global, and the marketing trends are changing with every passing day, Indian Instagram influencers are finding brand deals not just in India, but also in Germany. 

Few people know that Germany is now booming with Indian influencers attracting both brands and audiences alike in the European country. 

Multiple influencers are now working with German brands, and we will discuss how you too can find brand deals in Germany as an Indian influencer.

## 🌎 The German market is booming for Indian influencers

Over the years with increased international relations between India and Germany, many German brands are now ditching their local influencers and looking for Indian influencers to promote their products in Germany.

Increasingly, Indian Instagram influencers have been seen collaborating with German brands, which was virtually non-existent just a few years ago. 

Especially since the pandemic, the contributions from Indian influencers to the German brand market have surged mainly due to Germany having the highest Indian diaspora in Europe and the fourth globally. Many Indian influencers have started looking up to Germany to find brand deals, and there is a reason why.

India is economically ranked number one in the world, and over the past decade, Germany has become the largest partner of India in Europe with trade between the two countries growing well over 30% after the pandemic.

With more trade comes more business ties, and seeing how Germany has always had an appetite for Indian products and culture, it is only natural that German brands would want to attract Indians, and who better to attract them than local Indian influencers.

Let us discuss how Indian influencers can reach out to German brands for sponsorship and brand deals.

## 💁🏼‍♀️ How Indian Instagram influencers can find brand deals in Germany?

### 🎯 Know your niche

Before reaching out to brands, understanding your niche is vital. 

While some influencers are lifestyle influencers, others are fashion influencers or travel influencers. Finding sponsors that fit your niche is some of the first homework that Indian influencers must do if they want to land brand deals in Germany.

#### 📊 Target the right local audience

Targeting the right German audience is key to attracting the right brands. By filtering your audience based in Germany and getting insights for specific audiences in Germany, brands can see how many people that influencer can target in Germany. 

This can be achieved by changing your Instagram account to a business account, which also helps to access brand collaboration tools afterwards that can help land German sponsors.

#### 🌍 Stay globally relevant

When finding brand deals in another country, influencers must adjust their contents to attract a global audience. Short and precise posts with easy to understand language, instead of local jargons will make the content relevant.

Posting content that is specifically based in Germany or trending topics in Germany will definitely attract German brands that would want to reach Indian audiences and would want to collaborate with you in Germany.

### 💬 Direct messaging German brands

After filtering your audience, the next way to get brand deals is to directly message brands via their DM on Instagram. Many brands are now looking for direct influencers instead of going through marketing agencies, so this can work as a great advantage for Indian influencers trying to find brand deals in Germany.

Some brands may even have a collaborations email address where influencers can send proposals or inquiries for sponsorship. 

#### 🏷️ Influencer marketing platforms and agencies

Indian influencers can also partner with influencer marketing agencies and platforms that can help them find brand deals. Many influencer platforms have begun listing German brands looking for Indian influencers to partner with for collaborations too.

Brands that are looking for international influencers to represent them often go through marketing agencies, and influencer marketing is a massive industry that is growing well over 30% annually. 

German brands are no different, many influencer marketing agencies and platforms have begun popping up in Germany looking for Indian influencers to promote German brands to Indians.

#### 📸 Try TikTok

TikTok is one social media platform that is growing faster than Instagram. Many Indian influencers have begun using TikTok to find brand deals, as brands have also started sponsoring influencers on TikTok.

Interestingly, TikTok is actually not available in Germany due to a ban placed by the government. German brands are now trying to find ways to advertise through TikTok in Germany.

Many Indian influencers have found success in getting brand deals through TikTok, and while TikTok may not be available in Germany, Indian influencers can use TikTok to get sponsors that want to promote their product in Germany.

### 🔑 Key points to remember

- Identify your niche and target relevant German audiences
- Use business tools on Instagram
- DM brands or email collaborations address
- Join influencer marketing platforms
- Use TikTok as a leverage

## 🔍 Conclusion

The marketing game is changing, and Indian influencers should adapt to the changes.  

With last minute collaborations and almost immediate payments, going global opens a plethora of opportunities, and both Indian influencers and brands can leverage Germany to reach great heights in 2025 and beyond.
