In Thailand, Twitter is the most popular social media platform for influencers, with many boasting millions of followers. Brands work with these influencers to market their products and services, but how much do Thai Twitter influencers charge for promotional campaigns?

Marketing budgets vary by campaign, but brands can typically expect to pay between $1,000 to $3,000 per post on Twitter from influencers in Thailand.

## üìà Pricing Model

Thai Twitter influencers charge brands for advertising based on various pricing models.

### Flat Fee

The most common pricing model is the flat fee. Thai influencers charge a flat fee for advertising for a specific period, usually a few days or a week. This is the simplest pricing model, requiring no calculations or negotiations.

For example, Thai Twitter influencer Kwan Vacharaporn charges $1,500 for a week of promoting brands on Twitter. 

According to Kwan, her Twitter account has over 1.24 million followers with 5% engagement. She regularly collaborates with brands, including the Moet Hennessy Thailand wine and spirits company.

### Commission

Some Thai Twitter influencers charge on a commission basis. This means they receive a percentage of each sale generated by their promotional campaign.

For example, if a Thai influencer has a commission rate of 10% and sells $2,000 worth of products, they earn $200.

The downside of commission pricing is that it is unpredictable. Influencers will earn more or less depending on how well the campaign performs.

### Pay-Per-Lead

Another pricing model is pay-per-lead. Under this model, Thai Twitter influencers earn a fee every time someone takes a specific action as a result of their marketing efforts, such as signing up for a newsletter or filling out a contact form.

For example, if an influencer receives a $10 fee for each lead generated and obtains 25 leads, they earn $250.

The pay-per-lead model incentivizes influencers to be more persuasive in their promotional efforts, as their earnings depend on generating leads.

## üí≥ Payment Methods

Thai businesses can pay Twitter influencers using various payment methods, including:

### Bank Transfer

Many Thai brands prefer to pay influencers directly through bank transfers. This is a secure and reliable method of payment. However, it may take several days for the funds to be available in the influencer's account.

### E-Wallets

Thai influencers may also receive payments via e-wallets such as TrueMoney, LINE Pay, or Rabbit LINE Pay. E-wallets are becoming increasingly popular in Thailand due to their convenience and speed.

### Cryptocurrency

Some Thai Twitter influencers accept cryptocurrency payments, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. This payment method appeals to a niche audience of tech-savvy brands and influencers.

### Cash

Although less common, some Thai Twitter influencers may accept cash payments. This method may be more common for local businesses or smaller campaigns.

## üè¶ Legal Considerations

Both brands and influencers must comply with Thai laws and regulations surrounding advertising and promotional campaigns.

### Advertising Standards

Under Thai law, all advertising must be truthful, not misleading, and not harmful to the public. Brands and influencers must ensure their promotional content adheres to these standards.

### Contractual Agreements

It is essential to have a clear and detailed contract outlining the terms of the collaboration between brands and influencers. The contract should include payment terms, deliverables, timelines, and any legal considerations.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Contracts for Twitter Influencer Collaborations

When Thai brands and Twitter influencers collaborate, they typically use contracts to outline the terms and conditions of their partnership. Contracts help protect both parties in case of disputes.

Here are some key elements of influencer collaboration contracts in Thailand:

### Parties Involved

The contract should clearly identify the parties involved, including the brand and the influencer. It should include their official names, addresses, and contact information.

### Scope of Work

The contract should outline the scope of work to be performed by the influencer. This includes the specific deliverables, such as the number of Twitter posts, graphics, or videos, as well as any required hashtags or mentions.

### Payment Terms

The contract should specify the payment terms, including the total fee, payment method, and payment schedule. If the influencer is being paid on a commission or pay-per-lead basis, the contract should outline the rate and how earnings will be calculated.

### Timelines

The contract should include timelines for the project, such as when the influencer will start promoting the brand and when the campaign will end.

### Legal Considerations

The contract should address any legal considerations, such as confidentiality, intellectual property rights, and liability. It should also include a clause outlining the governing law in case of disputes.

### Termination

The contract should specify the conditions under which either party can terminate the agreement. This may include non-performance, breach of contract, or mutual consent.

In conclusion, influencer marketing on Twitter is a popular advertising strategy in Thailand. Brands can expect to pay Thai Twitter influencers between $1,000 to $3,000 per post depending on their follower count and engagement rates.
