Indian influencers are making a mark in Thailand. They are leaving no stone unturned in establishing a firm foothold in the Southeast Asian country. No longer limited to their home turf, Indian social media influencers, especially those on Facebook, are venturing out of the subcontinent and making their way to Thailand for brand deals.

### üì∏ A burgeoning opportunity 
According to [the Tourism Authority of Thailand](https://www.tatnews.org/travel/travel-thailand-india-2023/), India is Thailand‚Äôs target market for 2023, with the goal of attracting 2 million Indian visitors this year. 
The surge in Indian tourists means a rise in demand for Indian services in Thailand. The demand for Indian goods and services provides Indian social media influencers the opportunity to cash in on marketing deals with Indian brands in Thailand.

A Facebook influencer from Mumbai who goes by the handle @AashishBaba360 recently structured a six-day trip to Thailand that will see him cover Indian restaurants and entertainment spots in Thailand. The influencer is known for his videos on lifestyle and food.

In one of his posts, Baba stated, ‚ÄúIndians are coming to Thailand more than ever, and they are looking for something specific: They want Indian food and entertainment.‚Äù He said Indian restaurants in Thailand are looking to partner with content creators who are well-known in India to market Thai services to Indian tourists.

### üí∞ Wallet-friendly travel packages 
Indian influencers are not traveling to Thailand on their own budget. They are taking advantage of travel packages that allow them to cover the travel expenses.

Thailand travel agencies are now providing wallet-friendly travel packages that allow Indian influencers to travel to Thailand on an all-expense-paid basis in exchange for brand promotions on their social media accounts. 
Thai travel agencies are partnering with Indian influencers to promote their travel packages, while Thai Indian restaurants are offering food and accommodation to influencers who can promote their restaurants to Indian tourists.

A Facebook influencer based in Nashik named @kesavan.mahesh recently promoted a travel package to Thailand that was tailored for influencers. The package included a round trip from Mumbai to Bangkok, 3-star accommodation, excursions to the Phi Phi Islands, and city tours. All the influencer had to do in return was promote the travel agency and the travel package on his Facebook account.

Facebook influencers with a large following are not the only ones targeting Thailand. Influencers with a smaller follower count are also trying to make it big in Thailand.

Another Indian influencer, @thedesipartyman, recently shared a video of his arrival at the Don Mueang International Airport in Bangkok. The influencer is known for Bollywood dance videos.

His video amassing over 400,000 views indicates a rise in interest in Indian influencers in Thailand.

### üì¢ Indian influencers prefer Facebook marketing
Social media platforms like Koo, Instagram, and Twitter, are popular with Indian influencers, but Facebook remains the favorite. According to a [Nielsen report](https://www.influencermarketinghub.com/facebook-influencer-marketing/), Facebook is the most effective social media platform for influencer marketing.

Data from a 2023 report from Business Insider shows that 69% of Indian influencers preferred Facebook for their influencer marketing campaigns compared to only 56% who considered Instagram the best platform for influencer marketing.

The same report shows that Facebook influencers are 15% more effective at monetizing their services compared to Instagram influencers.

### üíº Legal loopholes make all-expense-paid brand deals in Thailand unlawful
While the advertising revenue generated from Facebook is taxable in Thailand, the loopholes in Indian and Thai laws mean that Indian influencers do not have to pay taxes when they participate in all-expense-paid brand deals in Thailand.

Thailand‚Äôs Department of Business Development (DBD) has made it mandatory for foreign YouTubers and influencers to register their business with the DBD if their work is based in Thailand and generates an income. Influencers who do not comply risk facing a fine of up to 100,000 Thai baht or imprisonment for up to six months.

The requirement is not applicable to Indian influencers since they are using their Facebook accounts which are based in India. They are deemed to be doing the promotions in India, meaning they are not earning income from Thailand.

Bahut Bindaas Paji, a popular Indian Facebook influencer, recently expressed his grievances concerning the matter. He stated that Indian influencers are not liable for taxes in Thailand, as they are not legally registered in the country.

He stated, ‚ÄúThis loophole allows them to take everything from Thailand, leaving nothing in return.‚Äù 
He recommended that Thai officials should find a way to have Indian influencers pay taxes for their promotions in Thailand.

### ‚ùó Thai officials voice dissatisfaction with Indian influencers
Although Indian influencers are cashing in on the brand deals in Thailand, it seems that Thai officials are not pleased with their antics.

Visitors to the Wat Phra Kaew temple in Bangkok have reported seeing a high number of Indian influencers filming dance videos at the temple. One of the tourists was quoted by the Independent as saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind seeing them dancing, but when they start filming and screaming, it ruins the atmosphere. They should really be more respectful.‚Äù

The temple's director, Rachata Kaewyoo, stated that the videos are being filmed at the temple, which was established to showcase Thailand‚Äôs culture. Kaewyoo indicated that the presence of Indian influencers has tarnished the sanctity of the temple.

In fact, a dress code has been implemented at the temple due to the rise of Indian influencers. Worshippers and visitors to the temple must wear long pants and shirts with sleeves to avoid offending Indian influencers.
According to a report from The Sun, the dress code was implemented in 2022 in response to complaints from Indian tourists who were often disturbed by scantily clad visitors who were filming social media videos at the temple.

### ü§ë Big commissions for Thai Indian restaurant promoters
Indian influencers who will be traveling to Thailand in search of brand deals will be pleased to know that they can earn sizable commissions for promoting Indian restaurants to Indian tourists.

Indian food is in demand in Thailand due to the influx of visitors from India. Indian restaurants in Thailand are transforming themselves into Bollywood-style hubs that will attract Indian tourists looking for a taste of home.

According to the The Times of India, Indian musicians, dancers, and comedians will be performing at Indian restaurants across Thailand. 
The venues will have curry and other Indian food staples on the menu. They will also have large screens where Bollywood movies will be screened. 

The Indian restaurant scene in Thailand has opened up new avenues for Indian influencers. They can now promote Thai Indian restaurants to Indian tourists, which will help the restaurant owners establish themselves as a go-to Indian restaurant for tourists.

Indian restaurant owners in Thailand are willing to pay social media influencers anywhere from 5,000 to 20,000 Thai baht for a promotional post on social media. 

The restaurant owners are especially interested in partnering with Indian influencers who can draw crowds to their restaurants. One restaurant owner was quoted as saying, ‚ÄúIf influencers have a decent following, their posts can generate a lot of interest and take the restaurant to the next level.‚Äù

### üéâ Indian influencers have an advantage in familiarity
While Indian influencers are facing challenges in Thailand, they have the advantage of familiarity. 
They better understand the preferences of Indian tourists and what they might be looking for in a restaurant. 

This familiarity will aid Indian influencers in Thailand when it comes to finding brand deals, especially with Indian restaurant owners who will be looking for influencers that can promote their restaurants effectively. 
Their knowledge of Indian culture and traditions will help Thai Indian restaurant owners market their services better to Indian customers.
