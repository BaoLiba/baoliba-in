YouTube influencers have a strong sway over Thai consumers, and influencer marketing is considered a potent tool for brands looking to increase their visibility in the country. 

If you're looking to expand your brand's reach in Thailand, partnering with local Thai YouTube influencers is a great way to penetrate the local market. Here's a comprehensive overview of the prevailing rates for collaboration with Thai YouTube influencers in 2025.

## üí∏ Thai YouTube influencer pricing overview 
A recent study reveals that Thai YouTubers charge between 6,350 THB to 16,400 THB per collaboration, with popular influencers charging even higher fees. 

Thai YouTube influencers typically charge based on the number of views their videos receive, with some influencers charging up to 70 percent of the value of the views they receive. 

For example, a YouTube influencer with 100,000 views can charge around 3,300 THB for their services.  

- 1,000 views = 70 THB
- 10,000 views = 700 THB

- 500,000 views = 35,000 THB
According to a Thai influencer marketing agency called Influence Asia, YouTube influencers can charge an average of around 96,000 THB for brand collaborations in 2025. 

Tiktok influencers charge slightly higher fees than YouTube influencers, with top Thai Tiktok influencers charging fees upwards of 170,000 THB.  

## üåü Thai YouTube influencer rates based on subscriber count
Here's a breakdown of the average rates charged by Thai YouTube influencers based on their subscriber count:

Other popular payment methods for various Thai influencers include PayPal, cryptocurrency, and Wise. 

## üìà The current state of Thai influencer marketing 
As the leading social media platform in Thailand, 66 percent of the Thai social media user base uses Facebook, with about 60 percent claiming to have purchased a product after seeing it promoted by a social media influencer. 

Instagram is the second most popular social media platform in Thailand, with 44 percent of the population using it consistently. According to reports, Thailand ranks fifth in the world for Instagram users. 

## ‚ùó Legal requirements for influencer marketing in Thailand 
The Thai government requires all influencers to display a clear disclaimer for all sponsored promotions. According to the Department of Business Development, influencers can either include a paid partnership hashtag in their captions or mention that they have been compensated for promoting a product. 

Failure to adhere to these rules can result in fines and other legal consequences. 

## ü¶∫ Risks of influencer marketing in Thailand 
The most concerning risk associated with influencer marketing is the risk of scams. Because anyone can call themselves an influencer, many scammers take advantage of advertisers looking to collaborate with influencers. 

In 2022, a group of prominent Thai influencers fell victim to a scammer, losing 11 million baht as a result of the fraudulent scheme. 

Holders of the popular Thai YouTube channel Hiso Hiso were among those who were tricked. They later made a media appearance to warn others to be cautious of such scams. 

## üìä Conclusion 
The rates charged by Thai influencers for their marketing services are generally lower than those charged by their Indian counterparts. 

If you're looking to expand your brand reach in Thailand, identifying and collaborating with local Thai influencers will ramp up your impact and help you grow faster in the local market.
