In recent years, India has significantly expanded its online presence. Social media influencers find their audiences not confined to their home states but can reach fans across the world.

Similarly, Indian citizens do not limit their online browsing to Indian websites and social media platforms. Many Indians find social media fame in foreign countries, with Nepal being particularly favorable among Indian influencers looking for brand deals. 

It is no surprise that Indian influencers scout for business opportunities in Nepal. 

Nepal has long been a popular travel destination for Indians. The two countries share centuries-old ties. However, many Nepalis have expressed frustration at the recent influx of Indian influencers overstaying their welcome. 

## üò≥ Nepalis Frustrated with Indian Influencers

Nepal's Ministry of Culture has expressed concern regarding Indian influencers spreading false information about its heritage and culture.  

In November 2022, Ministry Spokesman Suresh Acharya stated, ‚ÄúWe heard that some foreign influencers will visit Nepal. We will now inform related ministries for making arrangements so that they can share Nepali stories.‚Äù

Nepal is known as a humble country. The last thing Nepalese citizens want is for their country to be exploited by loud, obnoxious influencers. 

Nepali journalist Kedar Bhakta Mathur recently lamented the unfortunate increase in Indian influencers taking on prominent cultural identities to boost their follower count. 

Mathur said, ‚ÄúPretending to be Nepali social media influencers has become a trend for Indian influencers visiting Nepal. Some of them are seen wearing Daura-Suruwal (the traditional Nepali attire), and some go the extra mile to sport a topi (the traditional Nepali hat) to impersonate Nepali social media influencers. These wannabe Nepalis, with their pseudo-folk songs and videos flaunting Nepali dress, food, and lifestyle, are aimed at creating a false narrative about being a local influencer.‚Äù

The Nepali government has decided to combat this phenomenon by issuing a new visa regime for Indian social media influencers.

## üí∞ New Visa Regime for Indian Influencers

The new visa regime requires Indian social media influencers to apply for a specific visa before entering Nepal. 

Previously, Indian influencers did not require a visa to enter Nepal. They could stroll into the country as easily as they could cross a state border, which is why many Indian influencers have over-stayed their welcome.

Nepal's Foreign Minister Narayan Pratap Shah stated, ‚ÄúThere is a system in place to issue visas on arrival for Indian citizens. However, this is specifically for Indian nationals who are coming for business, tourism, or pilgrimage. There is no specific provision for social media influencers. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is drafting a new regulation in this regard.‚Äù

Nepal is known for its smooth and beautiful scenery, and its bustling cities.  The country attracts millions of Indian tourists each year. 

Nepal's population is around thirty million, of which twenty-three million are active on social media. This means that a significant portion of the Nepali populace is online, and many are familiar with India's social media influencers.

This new visa regime requires Indian influencers to prove that they have secured a brand deal in advance of their trip, as opposed to the previous system of securing deals after they entered Nepal.

## üìù Permanent Brand Deals Required

According to the Nepali government, ‚ÄúThe proposed visa for social media influencers will require them to have permanent brand deals amounting to at least USD 1 million with a Nepali company. The duration of these visas is expected to be at least five years. If their company remains operational, they can extend their stay indefinitely.‚Äù 

In the past, Indian influencers might arrive in Nepal with no specific brand deals intact. They would then secure deals upon arrival. 

Now, Indian influencers must line up their brand deals for the entirety of their trip, and not just a single deal. The Nepali government hopes this will ensure Indian influencers are serious about their craft and not just exploiting the landscape. 

## üìä 2023 Findings

A recent survey conducted by the Association of Television Media Nepal (ATMN) has revealed that Indian social media influencers channeling their expertise into Nepal is a phenomenon that deserves scrutiny.

The survey revealed that forty-seven percent of the Nepali populace has been subjected to social media posts or videos made by Indian influencers representing themselves as local influencers. 

The survey also found that thirty-three percent of Nepali social media users have seen Indian influencers wearing traditional Nepali clothing while claiming to be locals. 

Finally, a staggering seventy-three percent of respondents are concerned with how these Indian influencers are misrepresenting the culture of Nepal.

Indian influencers entering Nepal to find brand deals are not doing so entirely without scrutiny. 

## üòî Sad Indian Influencer Goes to Nepal

Joshi is an Indian influencer on the platform Twitter, known for his dramatic approach to influences and stories. 

In August 2023, Joshi tweeted, ‚ÄúI want to make a video about Nepal, but I want to wear Daura Suruwal (the traditional Nepali attire)! I don‚Äôt want any Nepali influencer to feel offended by this. I am going to wear cultural dress so I can respect and promote their culture. I also want to put on a topi. I want every Nepali to know I love them.‚Äù 

Joshi felt that his intentions were pure, and he wanted to represent his passion by making himself look like the people he was promoting. 

Joshi was uncomfortable that the country of Nepal was requiring him to prove he had a brand deal before entering Nepal. Despite being an Indian citizen, Joshi felt he was being treated like a foreigner. 

Joshi tweeted, ‚ÄúNepal has imposed a visa regime on Indian influencers! They want the Indian influencer to show proof of a brand deal before entering Nepal. This is sad! I am an Indian citizen. I don‚Äôt need a visa for a visa-exempt travel! Why does Nepal want me to do extra work?‚Äù 

Joshi was emotionally distraught that he would have to jump through hoops just to show his admiration for Nepal. 

## üí° Finding Influencer Brand Deals in Nepal

Indian influencers can expect to find Nepali brands lining up to sign deals with them. 

Nepal is not only particularly attractive to Indian tourists, but it is also famous for having a friendly population. This is likely why Indian influencers have historically been so successful in Nepal.

Now, with the new visa regulations, Indian influencers looking for brand deals in Nepal will need to procure those deals in advance. 

Finding brand deals in advance can be a difficult endeavor even for seasoned influencers. 

Fortunately, Indian influencers are known to be resourceful, and there are various ways to find and seal brand deals in Nepal. 

## üè¢ Local Influencer Marketing Agencies

Just as they do in India, influencer marketing agencies in Nepal can find brand deals for Indian influencers looking to cash in on the country‚Äôs intrigue.

Typically, influencer marketing agencies are made up of a network of vetted influencers who help each other secure collaborations. 

Nepali influencer marketing agencies operate similarly. There are numerous influencer marketing agencies in Nepal that Indian influencers can reach out to for brand deals. 

One such agency is Nepal‚Äôs leading influencer marketing service, Creative Brand Agency. 

The agency is dedicated to serving brands by generating authentic engagement through influential personalities. The agency specializes in services ranging from establishing influencer relationships to planning and executing campaigns. 

Hashtag influencer is another Nepali influencer marketing agency that Indian influencers can reach out to for brand deals. 

Hashtag influencer assures that it delivers outstanding influencer marketing campaigns by utilizing its extensive influencer network to bring brands and influencers together. 

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Influencers Marketing Other Influencers

Aside from marketing agencies, Indian influencers can also reach out directly to Nepali influencers to gain brand deals. 

Nepali influencers are already in touch with brands and might want to cash in on the Indian influencer phenomenon. If they can secure a brand deal for an Indian influencer, they can then take a cut of that deal for themselves. 

Nepali influencers are very likely to be receptive to this request. After all, it is likely that they themselves would be honored to work with an Indian influencer. 

Nepali influencer Sundar Dhamala is a great example of a Nepali influencer who can help Indian influencers secure brand deals. 

Dhamala is an actor, storyteller, and influencer. According to his profile, Dhamala produces viral content on social media. He regularly collaborates with a variety of brands to promote their products and services. 

## üì± Reaching Out on Social Media

Nepali influencers like Dhamala can be contacted directly on social media. Most Nepali influencers can be found on popular platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. 

Although Instagram is a popular platform for influencers, Twitter is still considered a powerhouse among Nepali influencers. 

Nepal has a vibrant Twitter scene, where it seems everyone is an influencer. In fact, Twitter is so common among the Nepali populace that it was nicknamed the ‚ÄúNepali Street.‚Äù 

Therefore, Indian influencers should join Twitter and follow Nepali influencers like Dhamala to find brand deals. 

## üí≥ Accepting Payments in Nepal

Once an Indian influencer finds a brand deal in Nepal, they will be required to get paid. 

In the past, Indian influencers could cross the Nepalese border without a visa. This made it easy for them to find deals and also get paid. 

Now that Nepal is requiring Indian influencers to secure brand deals in advance, they will have to get paid remotely instead of in person. 

The most popular way for Indian influencers to get paid by Nepali brands is through digital remittance services. 

Nepal has a growing fintech scene, and many Nepali brands are already using fintech platforms to pay for services. Indian influencers should familiarize themselves with fintech services such as eSewa, Khalti, IME Pay, and others.   

These services allow Indian influencers to receive payment quickly and easily. 

## ‚ùó Considerations for Indian Influencers in Nepal

Nepal is allowing Indian influencers to secure brand deals, however, there are still some hurdles they should be aware of. 

In November 2023, a reality TV star from India was detained in Nepal for violating a tourist visa. 

Indian influencer Anjali Arora had traveled to Nepal to celebrate her birthday with friends; however, she failed to secure a brand deal. 

Arora, who has over thirteen million followers on Instagram, had gained quite a bit of attention online. Unfortunately, aside from her fame, Arora had not made any arrangements for her trip. 

The Nepali government caught wind of her plans, and she was detained when she arrived at the airport. 

Nepal is still open to Indian influencers seeking brand deals. However, they need to be aware of the requirements and restrictions surrounding visa and travel regulations. If they can manage all of that, Indian influencers should have no problem finding brand deals in Nepal.
