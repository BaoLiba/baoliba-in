Though the majority of Instagram influencers are still favored for their status and reach, Snapchat influencers are starting to gain recognition and brand deals of their own. They are now hot on the heels of their more popular counterparts, with many already obtaining lucrative partnerships with brands from different parts of the world.

In India, Snapchat influencers looking to earn a living by promoting products and services have turned to dedicated influencer marketing agencies to connect them to brands seeking to reach international markets for greater career advancement.

In the United States, home to the largest corporate brands, influencers are already taking up valuable real estate of some of the biggest advertising platforms. Agencies like UnInfluenced and PUMPING UP are already connected with influencers armed with their homemade content. Talented Indian Snapchat influencers are tapping into these agencies to receive brand deals from American firms for products and services.


## ü§≥ The Rise of Snapchat Influencers

The rise of Snapchat influencers over Instagram influencers stems from the former's capacity to attract a more youthful demographic, which makes them better suited for brands that have products and services targeted at youngsters. 

While a Snapchat influencer can have a smaller following, the platform is adept at producing a more valuable audience, especially with brands that have something to say. Brands can gain traction with their target audience through Snapchat influencers who can initiate conversations and spark engagement.

As it happens, Snapchat users are already accustomed to engaging with adverts in their feeds, making it easier for brands to make a case for their products and services. Additionally, Snapchat influencers are known for their creative flair, skillfully hiding promotional messages in their homemade content in a way that entertains while informing audiences.


## üíÅ Agencies Assist Influencers

Unlike other social media platforms, Snapchat requires influencers to earn their reach rather than accumulate followers. This is a feat that requires lots of effort, talent, and a bit of luck. Recognizing this, agencies that assist Indian Snapchat influencers have emerged to help them get their foot in the door of the global influencer economy.

Influencer marketing agencies act as a bridge between influencers and brands. They help influencers enhance their discoverability and profile while making it easier for brands to find suitable partners for their marketing campaigns. Many agencies focus on influencer matchmaking, while others also provide additional services to enhance influencers' visibility.

For example, influencer marketing agency The Social HQ is a full-service influencer marketing agency that connects brands with influencers across all major social media platforms, including Snapchat. They assist influencers by managing their communication with brands and even arranging fully funded influencer trips in the United States.

Social media marketing agency Cibyl is another influencer marketing agency that helps Indian Snapchat influencers gain brand deals from American firms. By creating and curating engaging content, Cibyl assists influencers in increasing their visibility and audience size.

Unlike other platforms, where influencers can reach out and apply for brand deals on their own, Snapchat influencers must go through agencies to build their profiles and connect with brands.


## üè¶ Payment Options

Once an influencer has been accepted by an agency and secured a brand partnership, they can begin working on the agreed deliverables. Deliverables are the promotional messages and promotional content that the influencer must create and share on their Snapchat handle in exchange for the tactical payments made by the brand through the agency.

Payment options for Indian Snapchat influencers can vary depending on the agency and the arrangements made with the brand. However, many influencer marketing agencies provide incentives for influencers to partner with them. Agencies usually have an overarching profit-sharing arrangement with influencers, so any sponsorship or brand deal payment that an influencer receives is usually transferred through the agency to the influencer‚Äôs bank account.

While Indian Snapchat influencers can earn large amounts of money for brand deals, they must be wise with their finances since they often do not have a steady income. 

Most influencer marketing agencies do a good job of procuring sponsorship and brand deal payments from brands. Some agencies charge higher commissions, but they can help influencers earn more money overall. For example, influencer marketing agency Collab has a 25 percent commission on all proceeds earned by influencers, which may seem a bit steep. However, Collab helps influencers in various ways, including negotiating higher rates for brand deals, which provides significant returns for influencers.

Most payments are made in the form of wire transfers through international money remittance services like Western Union, MoneyGram, and Wise. Sometimes payment services like Paypal are used. 
Indian Snapchat influencers can also receive payments in cryptocurrency, which can be a lucrative option given the crypto market‚Äôs volatility.


## üñäÔ∏è Legal Agreements 

To protect both parties, legal contracts are established for influencer arrangements. Influencers must complete all deliverables as agreed; otherwise, they may face financial penalties, including having to return payments received. Additionally, influencers must comply with laws safeguarding consumers from misleading advertising. 

The Federal Trade Commission requires influencers in the United States to disclose any material connection with a brand or product before making a promotional claim or endorsement. This also applies to influencers based outside of the United States.

Under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, the Act prohibits false or misleading statements in commercial advertising and promotion. Since advertising on social media is still considered advertising, its provisions are applicable to advertising on social media platforms. Violations can lead to legal actions from the FTC or from consumers who feel defrauded.

While the onus is on influencers to comply, agencies often represent influencers in legal matters and assist them with legal compliance. 


## üëÄ Future Trends

According to marketing expert Mahi Anand of MLH Marketing, ‚ÄúThe evolution of apps like Snapchat has created a new breed of influencers who are showing companies that they can rely on influencers to expand their reach and engage otherwise unreachable audiences.‚Äù 

In the future, Snapchat influencers will likely bear more relevance in the influencer economy, especially with Indian Snapchat influencers who are already looking to earn brand deals from competitive markets like the United States. 

Influencer marketing agency Socially Powerful estimates that, from 2023 to 2025, Snapchat users will grow to 538 million worldwide, which will pose new opportunities for brands and marketers.

‚ÄúSnapchat is likely to play an important role as the next generation of consumers, the Gen Alpha cohort enters the shopping world,‚Äù Anand added. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs especially true because Gen Alpha is projected to be the most influential generation when it comes to spending decisions, according to the World Economic Forum.‚Äù

The influencer marketing channel is expected to become even more attractive to brands, making influencer marketing agencies more capable of assisting Indian Snapchat influencers with brand deals from American firms. 

While many local marketing agencies have an emphasis on social media marketing, influencer marketing agencies are focused solely on influencer marketing. This makes them better suited to assist influencers in growing their profile, getting brand deals, and receiving payments.
