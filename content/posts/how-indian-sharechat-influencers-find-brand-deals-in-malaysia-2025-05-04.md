The rise of ShareChat influencers in Malaysia is becoming a trend among Indian brands. Look at how they find brand deals.

---

Although Malaysia is located in Southeast Asia, it has a significant Indian diaspora. In fact, Malaysia is home to the largest population of Indians outside of India. The Malaysian Indian population is mainly descended from Tamil laborers from Southern India who migrated to Malaysia over several generations starting from the British colonial era.

In recent years, ShareChat influencers in India have started to target Malaysian nationals for their brand endorsement deals. Many of them have been successful in reaching out to Malaysian brands and securing lucrative marketing contracts. 


## üìà ShareChat influencers in Malaysia

ShareChat is an Indian social media network and one of the fastest-growing apps in the world. It was launched in 2015 and is used by millions of people across India. ShareChat allows users to create and share entertaining and informative content in various Indian languages.

The app has gained immense popularity in recent years, particularly among the youth. The average age of ShareChat users is around 26, making it a key platform for reaching the younger demographic. 

On ShareChat, people can upload videos, photos, and text posts, and interact with each other's content in various ways. Users can follow and be followed, like and repost content, and use various hashtags to increase the visibility of their posts. 

In India, creators on ShareChat are commonly referred to as ShareChat influencers. They create content on the platform to amass followers. Brands then partner with them to promote their products and services in exchange for a fee or commission. 

Currently, there are over 300 million creators on ShareChat, making it one of the largest platforms for influencers in the world.

According to a report by global analytics firm RedSeer, the influencer marketing industry in India is expected to grow to 30,000 crore rupees (approximately RM15 billion) by 2030. The increasing popularity of ShareChat influencers in Malaysia is a prime example of how Indian influencers are expanding their reach into other countries, particularly in Southeast Asia.


## üí∞ How they find brand deals

The majority of ShareChat influencers in India partner with Malaysian brands by leveraging their existing connections in Malaysia. They utilize messaging apps like Telegram, WhatsApp, and Instagram to contact Malaysian brands directly. 

Telegram is a widely used messaging app in many Southeast Asian countries, including Malaysia. Because of its robust features, Telegram is often used by entrepreneurs and brands for marketing purposes. 

The ability to create large groups of up to 200,000 members and channels with unlimited subscribers has made Telegram a popular choice for brands looking to communicate with their audience. 

For example, a Malaysian-made fruit juice product recently partnered with a Tamil ShareChat influencer from India to promote their product. 


## üì± The power of WhatsApp

WhatsApp is another popular messaging app used by ShareChat influencers in India to find brand deals in Malaysia. In fact, WhatsApp is the most popular social media platform in Malaysia, with around 81% of the Malaysian population using it. 

WhatsApp is used for everything from personal chats to business communications. It allows users to send messages, make voice and video calls, and share photos, documents, and other media. 

Because of WhatsApp's popularity in Malaysia, many ShareChat influencers in India have had success in reaching out to Malaysian brands and securing lucrative marketing contracts. 


## üåü Instagram's role

Instagram is also a key platform for ShareChat influencers to find brand deals in Malaysia. Many of these influencers have created Instagram profiles to showcase their content and connect with brands. 

Instagram is a highly visual platform that allows users to share photos and videos, interact with their audience through stories and reels, and build a personal brand. It is widely used by influencers to promote their content and attract brand partnerships. 

Instagram's features, such as hashtags and location tags, allow ShareChat influencers to increase their visibility and reach a larger audience, including Malaysian brands looking for influencers to promote their products and services.


## ü§ë Payment methods

ShareChat influencers in India are getting paid by Malaysian brands through various payment methods. The most common payment method is through international bank transfers, which allow funds to be transferred from one country's bank account to another. 

However, international bank transfers can be slow and expensive, with high fees and unfavorable exchange rates. As a result, many ShareChat influencers in India have turned to online payment platforms to receive their payments. 

One of the most popular online payment platforms used by ShareChat influencers in India is PayPal. PayPal allows users to send and receive money online, making it a convenient option for influencers to receive payments from Malaysian brands. 

Other popular online payment platforms used by ShareChat influencers in India include Wise, Stripe, and Payoneer.

## ‚ùó Legal considerations

While collaborating with Malaysian brands can be lucrative for ShareChat influencers in India, they must also be aware of the legal considerations involved in such partnerships. The following are some key legal issues that influencers should consider when working with Malaysian brands:

### 1. Contracts

Influencers should always have a written contract that outlines the terms of the partnership with the brand. This contract should include details such as the scope of work, payment terms, and duration of the partnership. 

Having a written contract helps protect both parties in case of any disputes or misunderstandings.

### 2. Disclosure

Influencers must disclose their partnerships with brands to their audience. In Malaysia, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) has established guidelines for advertising and sponsorships in the digital space. 

Influencers should clearly label sponsored content and ensure that their audience understands that they are being compensated for promoting the brand's products or services.

### 3. Intellectual property

Influencers should be aware of intellectual property rights when creating content for brands. They should ensure that they have the necessary permissions to use any copyrighted materials in their content, such as music or images. 

Additionally, influencers should clarify their rights to the content they create for brands, including whether they can use it in their portfolio or for future promotions.

### 4. Taxes

Influencers should be aware of their tax obligations when receiving payments from foreign brands. They may need to report their income to the tax authorities in India and, depending on their tax treaty with Malaysia, they may be liable for taxes in Malaysia as well.
