In a world where social media influencers are reaping millions in brand deals, most Indian influencers still cling to their Instagram accounts for lucrative collaborations. Unfortunately, Instagram influencer marketing is all but dead in the Western world—it is no longer a reliable way to secure deals.  

While many believe that Instagram’s decline spells the end of influencer marketing altogether, Indian influencers are now reporting an increase in lucrative LinkedIn deals. Those cashing in on the growing trend of LinkedIn influencer marketing include many Indian influencers cashing in on the Japanese market. 


## 🧠 The Japanese Market is Fickle
When it comes to influencer marketing, the Japanese market is the most difficult to penetrate. Japanese consumers are extremely fickle and skeptical when it comes to advertising, particularly foreign advertising. They are also less susceptible to celebrity endorsements than their Western counterparts. 

As a result, it is important to have a local influencer who can effectively place the brand in the best possible light. This is where Indian LinkedIn influencers come in. They are quick to understand the nuances of the Japanese market, including the culture and language. 


## 🌸 Leveraging Cultural Ties
It is not uncommon for Indian influencers to have cultural ties with their Japanese brands. 

Many Indian influencers are sari manufacturers, henna artists, or Indian cuisine experts who have local suppliers in Japan. They often work with these brands as consultants, helping them to better serve their Indian consumers. 

They may also have Japanese relatives or friends who work in the marketing department of some of these companies, or belong to a Japanese business association. These influencers typically know when a company is looking for more exposure to boost sales. 


## 💸 Commission Deals

The way Indian LinkedIn influencers get paid for these deals is also quite different from Instagram collaborations. 

According to Indian LinkedIn influencer marketing agency, Babbler, most Indian influencers usually earn a commission from direct sales or leads generated instead of upfront payment for posts or videos. 

In addition to the commission, Babbler ensures that each of these influencers earns a minimum of 3,000,000 INR in total payments from their brand deals by 2025. 


## 📈 Growing Demand for Indian LinkedIn Influencers in Japan

The number of Indian LinkedIn influencers who are working to generate brand deals in Japan is expected to rise by 50% in 2025. 

According to the Linkedin Global Trends 2023 report, 61% of marketers in Asia Pacific are expected to increase their budget for LinkedIn influencer marketing, while just 18% of them expect to increase their budgets for influencer marketing on Instagram, TikTok, or Facebook. 

This trend looks to continue as Babbler reports that 68% of marketers globally are expected to increase their influencer marketing budgets in 2025.
