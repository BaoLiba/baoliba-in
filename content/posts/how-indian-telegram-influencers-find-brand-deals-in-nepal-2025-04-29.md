Nepal is a country with a very specific kind of charm. It’s beautiful, the people are lovely, and the culture is rich. But there’s a catch. Being a Nepali, you may have noticed that a lot of things are better than them; like food, films, and well, social media.

Nepalis have the innate ability to spice up even the dullest of things, but if there’s one thing they can never beat, it’s the Indian version of the same thing. Just ask a Nepali about the Indian version of a Nepali folk song, and you’d get a whole lecture about how Indians just do everything better.

This is especially true when it comes to social media. From the way they do marketing, to the quality of the content, Indians have always been better than the rest of us in the subcontinent. And when it comes to Telegram, it’s the influencers there that are stealing the show.

Yes, Indian Telegram influencers are becoming increasingly popular among Nepali brands who are hiring them for marketing. And by the looks of it, this trend is going to grow even more in the future.


## 📢 Why Are Indian Telegram Influencers Popular In Nepal?

Telegram is known for being a lot less strict compared to other social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. This has made it a great platform for online advertisements, especially for the adult variety. And since there are a lot of adult-centric products and services in Nepal, Telegram has always been a go-to platform for Nepali digital marketers.

But recently, many Nepali brands have started to look towards Indian influencers for marketing on Telegram. The main reason behind this is that Indian influencers on Telegram are simply better than Nepali influencers.

Telegram influencers from India generally have a lot more subscribers than Nepali influencers. On average, Indian influencers have anywhere between 10,000 to 10 million followers, while Nepali influencers have anywhere between 100 to 1 million followers.

Even in terms of professionality, Indian influencers are a lot better than Nepali influencers. The content produced by Indian influencers is a lot more visually appealing than Nepali influencers. They have better editing skills, and they also know how to use Telegram’s features better than their Nepali counterparts. For example, Indian influencers don’t just post boring content, they create whole series on Telegram, which keeps their audience hooked.

So, in a nutshell, Indian Telegram influencers are better than Nepali influencers in every possible way. And this is why Nepali brands are hiring Indian Telegram influencers for marketing.


## 📊 Are Nepali Brands Hiring Indian Influencers on Telegram?

Nepali brands hiring Indian influencers on Telegram may sound ludicrous, but that’s what’s actually happening. According to sources, many Nepali brands are using Indian influencers on Telegram to promote their products and services.

A report from The Indian Express stated that a Nepali travel agency recently hired a well-known Indian adult Telegram influencer to promote their services. The owner of the travel agency said that there is a growing trend of Indian Telegram influencers promoting products and services in Nepal. 

He also said that hiring Indian influencers is a lot more efficient than hiring Nepali influencers because they have a lot more followers and they’re also a lot better than Nepali influencers. 

A Nepali entrepreneur who runs an adult-themed Telegram channel said that he has been hiring Indian adult Telegram influencers for quite some time now. He said, “The followers of these Indian Telegram influencers are mainly Nepali. They are aware of our products, how to use them, and their importance. They also have a large number of followers.”

Nepal has a booming adult industry that employs thousands of people. The industry is worth billions of rupees, and it’s only getting bigger. The Nepali adult industry is still growing, and it hasn’t reached its full potential yet. But despite its potential, the industry is still plagued by a lot of problems, the biggest one being stigma. 

Adult businesses in Nepal are often illegal, so they have to operate in secrecy, which makes advertising in Nepal very difficult. But Telegram has allowed them to find their footing in the online world. And now that they’re able to reach a wider audience, they’re starting to see how powerful advertising can be. 

So, it’s only natural that they would turn towards Indian Telegram influencers for advertising. Since they have a lot of Nepali followers, advertising through them gives Nepali adult businesses the kind of exposure they’ve been looking for. 


## 📊 The Rise of Indian Telegram Influencers in Nepal 

But it’s not just the adult industry that’s hiring Indian Telegram influencers. Many Nepali brands in different sectors are hiring Indian Telegram influencers to promote their products and services. 

According to a recent report from Himalayan Times, an Indian actress and model, Amisha Patel was hired by a Nepali brand, Haffiz Fitness to promote their gym in Kathmandu. This is a non-adult example, which shows that Indian Telegram influencers are being hired by more than just the adult sector.

In the report, a spokesperson from Haffiz Fitness said that Amisha Patel was chosen because they wanted to take their gym to the next level. They said that they wanted to make their gym the best gym in Nepal, and to do that, they needed the help of the best Indian influencer on Telegram. 

They also said that they don’t care about whether the influencer is adult or non-adult, as long as they get the reach they want, they would use any influencer. 

## 💡 How Are Indian Telegram Influencers Getting Hired in Nepal? 

This begs the question, how are Indian Telegram influencers getting hired in Nepal? This is a question that many of you may have when reading this article. Well, the answer is that Indian influencers are getting hired by Nepali brands in the same way they’re getting hired by Indian brands.
