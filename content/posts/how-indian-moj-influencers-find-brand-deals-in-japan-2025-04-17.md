### üí∞ Brand deals Indian Moj influencers have secured in Japan

As mentioned earlier, it is not uncommon for Moj to house influencers who are not only recognized in India but also across the globe.

Recently, several Moj influencers have secured brand deals in Japan. Brand deals that require them to travel hundreds of miles and potentially spend weeks on end outside of their own countries.¬†

According to sources, these brand deals were secured via an endorsement marketing platform known as BaoLiba.¬†

Reports indicate that the brand deals were for a Japanese restaurant chain that sought to tap into the Indian market.¬†

The Moj influencers would be required to document their experience within the restaurants on the Moj platform.

### ü™ô Why Moj influencers are your best bet

Moj influencers are very much needed in the world of influencer marketing today. With the advancement of technology and the rise of social media, captivating audiences has become more difficult.

Thanks to the features of the Moj platform, Moj influencers possess qualities that set them apart from their competitors.

- **Creative content**
Moj influencers produce creative content that captures the hearts of millions. The platform allows its influencers to be free and open with their creativity, which allows their content to shine through the clutter.
- **Rapid turnarounds**
Moj influencers work much faster than their competitors, especially those on platforms such as Instagram or Facebook. This allows brands to achieve their goals faster than ever before.
- **Cost effective**
Moj influencers are also much cheaper than their competitors, allowing companies to save thousands on marketing costs.
- **Massive engagement**
Despite the popularity of other platforms, the engagement rates of Moj influencers are far higher. From comments to likes to shares, Moj influencers boast the highest engagement rates on the market today.

### üì¢ How does Moj compare to other platforms?

Moj is specifically catered to the Indian market, which means that its influencers work in tandem with the demands of the people.

There are several other platforms that offer influencer marketing services. However, these platforms house only a handful of influencers who can actually connect with their audience.

- **YouTube**
Reportedly, YouTube boasts more than 2 billion active users worldwide, with over 80% of these users living outside of the United States. YouTube influencers usually create longer videos, making it harder for them to captivate audiences' attention.
As a result, YouTube influencers typically charge higher fees than Moj influencers. On average, YouTube influencers charge around $2750 per post, compared to Moj influencers' price tag of just $2000.
However, if you are only concerned about securing deals with popular influencers, YouTube influencers may be the best option.
- **TikTok**
After falling behind both YouTube and Moj, TikTok boasts around 1 billion active users. In recent years, the platform has struggled with marketing and advertising, leaving a massive gap for brands to fill.
Despite its lack of focus on content creators and brands, many companies still flock to the platform due to its engagement rates and influencer popularity.
However, like YouTube influencers, TikTok influencers can be more demanding when it comes to brand deals. They often charge around $4000 for a simple post.
- **Instagram**
With around 1.3 billion active users, Instagram sits comfortably between Moj and TikTok. Although Instagram is a favorite among businesses, its influencer market is quite the opposite.
Instagram influencers often charge as much as $5000 per post. This is largely due to the platform's massive user base and businesses' persistent obsession with it.¬†
As a result, Instagram influencers comprise nearly 50% of the influencer marketing market.

### üç£ Japanese brands using Moj influencers to attract Indian customers

Japan is home to several brands looking to penetrate the Indian market. However, due to cultural differences, these brands may experience challenges reaching their intended audiences.

One way they can effectively reach Indian audiences is through Indian Moj influencers. Since these influencers possess the knowledge and experience needed to communicate across cultures, they can bridge the gap between the brands and the audiences.

- **Muji**
Muji is one of Japan's leading lifestyle brands. The company is known for its minimalist and functional products ranging from home goods to clothing.¬†
According to reports, Muji has already made a name for itself in India, having opened several stores in various Indian retail hubs. However, the company is still looking to tap into more Indian audiences.
Using Moj influencers can help Muji to do just that. Influencers can create engaging videos showcasing Muji‚Äôs products, capturing the attention of millions of potential customers.
- **Toshiba**
Toshiba is a world leader in electronic systems and semiconductors. The company's commitment to sustainability and innovation has made it a household name across the globe.¬†
However, like Muji, Toshiba is still struggling to reach its Indian audience. Moj influencers can help solve this problem.
By showcasing Toshiba‚Äôs products and services to Indian audiences, influencers can create a stronger brand awareness for the company in India.
- **Sony**
Sony is a Japanese conglomerate known for its electronics, gaming, and entertainment. The company is also a powerhouse in the tech industry, boasting several popular products such as the PlayStation and Xperia line of smartphones.
Despite Sony‚Äôs popularity in India, Moj influencers can help boost the company‚Äôs brand awareness even further.
Sony can leverage Moj influencers to promote their existing products and services while also generating buzz around future releases.
- **Toyota**
Japan is known for producing world-class vehicles. One of Japan‚Äôs most notable automobile manufacturers is Toyota.
Despite Toyota‚Äôs success in India, the company is still looking to penetrate deeper into the Indian market. Moj influencers can help strengthen the company‚Äôs brand presence in India.
By showing off the many features and benefits of Toyota vehicles, influencers can showcase the company‚Äôs commitment to quality and customer satisfaction.

### ‚ùó Risks for Japanese brands using Moj influencers

While there are many benefits to using Moj influencers, there are also several risks that Japanese brands should be aware of.

- **Limited demographics**
Moj influencers mainly cater to Indian audiences. Therefore, Japanese brands that are looking to penetrate markets other than India may find that partnering with Moj influencers has little to no effect on their growth.
- **Lack of engagement**
Despite boasting millions of followers, not every Moj influencer has a highly engaged audience. Because of this, Japanese brands may find that the influencers they partner with do not generate the desired return on investment.
- **Inconsistent messaging**
Moj influencers are free to create content however they see fit. Because of this, brands may find that their messaging is inconsistent or inaccurate. This can mislead audiences and lead to reputational damage for the brands.
- **Obsession with followers**
It is no secret that many influencers are obsessed with vanity metrics such as followers. Because of this, many influencers will go to great lengths to increase their follower count. This includes purchasing fake followers.
Brands that partner with influencers who have purchased fake followers will find that they are often being deceived. Fake followers do not engage with content, which renders the brand deal ineffective.

### ‚ùó Tips for Japanese brands seeking Moj influencers for cross-border marketing

Japanese brands looking to secure Moj influencers for international marketing must ensure they are choosing the right partners.¬†

Here are a few tips to ensure they are working with the right influencers.

- **Quality over quantity**
Brands should always choose Moj influencers who have a highly engaged audience rather than those who only boast a plethora of followers.
- **Use an influencer marketing platform**
Influencer marketing platforms like BaoLiba can help brands find reputable influencers. These platforms often vet the influencers that they house, making it easier for brands to select the right partners.
- **Evaluate past work**
Brands can vet influencers by analyzing their previous work. Checking to see if the influencer has worked with businesses that are similar to theirs can indicate whether or not the influencer is qualified for the brand deal.
- **Use reliable tools**
Brands can also utilize tools like HypeAuditor or Upfluence to assess influencer performance metrics. Using these tools, brands can find out important data such as engagement rates and audience quality scores.
