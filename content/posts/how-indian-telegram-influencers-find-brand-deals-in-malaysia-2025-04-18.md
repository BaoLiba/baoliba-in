Telegram influencers from India are taking over Malaysia, one brand deal at a time.

In fact, this phenomenon is so absurdly amusing that even Malaysian TikTok users are posting videos of Indian Telegram influencers enticing Malaysian women into prostitution rings.

People from other countries are falling for influencers from India and their unsolicited DMs.

An example of this is a Malaysian TikTok user who posted how an Indian Telegram influencer claimed he could provide her with a one-way flight ticket to India as well as accommodation and a job as an escort if she would agree to be flown to a place in India called Uttarakhand.

But this Malaysian girl was smart enough to see through the scam and record her conversation with the Indian Telegram influencer for others to see.


Moreover, according to a popular Malaysian website, the trend of Indian Telegram influencers targeting Malaysian women has recently gained traction in Malaysia, where others think it is funny and harmless while others are concerned that these shady Indian Telegram influencers will end up being successful in their endeavors.

## 📈 Telegram Influencers from India Targeting Malaysian Brands 

Aside from the dubious, seedy side of Indian Telegram influencers trying to recruit Malaysian women into prostitution, local brands in Malaysia have also noticed that Indian Telegram influencers have been targeting them for brand deals.

This is due to the fact that Indian Telegram influencers have large audiences of their own in Malaysia.

According to the Malaysian marketing site called Marketing In Asia, an Indian Telegram influencer by the name of Kunal Yadav has garnered attention from Malaysian brands to promote products from Malaysia.

He has a Telegram channel where he regularly posts videos of himself dancing to popular trending songs.

And this Indian Telegram influencer claims that he has more than 432,000 Telegram subscribers and that businesses in Malaysia have been reaching out to him for brand deals to promote their products.

Additionally, Kunal Yadav told Marketing in Asia that he has a self-produced song that has gone viral on TikTok and that he has collaborated with Malaysian brands like MIVI and BOSE.

What's more, another Indian Telegram influencer who goes by the name of Shahrukh Khan has also been gaining traction among Malaysian brands.

According to Marketing in Asia, Shahrukh Khan has worked with several Malaysian companies for brand deals, including a Malaysian hotel, a Malaysian makeup entrepreneur, and a Malaysian telecommunications company.

This Indian Telegram influencer has a following of 1.54 million subscribers on Telegram and has posted more than 160 videos of himself dancing, singing, and engaging in stunts.

And just like Kunal Yadav, Shahrukh Khan has also gained significant traction on TikTok.

## 🇲🇾 How Indian Telegram Influencers are Reaching Malaysian Brands

According to Marketing in Asia, Indian Telegram influencers like Shahrukh Khan and Kunal Yadav were actually introduced to Malaysian brands via an international talent agency called BaoLiba.

According to their website, BaoLiba has over 1 million international influencers and celebrities registered on their platform, and they specialize in connecting brands with influencers to create successful collaborations that meet both the brand's marketing objectives and the influencer's goals.

Specifically, for Indian Telegram influencers seeking brand deals in Malaysia, they can sign up on BaoLiba and profile their influences.

Once they do this, Malaysian brands can search for Indian Telegram influencers that meet their criteria and then reach out to them for brand deals.

According to Marketing in Asia, many Malaysian brands have switched from advertising to influencer marketing. This has made it even easier for Indian Telegram influencers to seek brand deals in Malaysia.

Even news sites in Malaysia have reported about the trend of Indian Telegram influencers contacting Malaysian brands for brand deals. 

For example, a local Malaysian news site called Harian Metro reported that Indian Telegram influencers have started reaching out to Malaysian brands for brand deals via WhatsApp, Telegram, and email.

## 📞 Indian Telegram Influencers Contacting Malaysian Brands Directly

According to Harian Metro, the trend of Indian Telegram influencers contacting Malaysian brands directly for brand deals started last year in 2022.

This Malaysian news site interviewed the Malaysian business owner of a cosmetics company called Anya Skincare. 

She said that she was surprised when she received an inquiry from an Indian Telegram influencer for a brand deal opportunity.

The Indian Telegram influencer reached out to her directly via WhatsApp.

The Indian Telegram influencer said he had over 100,000 subscribers on Telegram and that he could charge RM 300 for a promotion post if the Malaysian cosmetic brand owner would hire him as an influencer.

The Malaysian business owner then shared the screenshot of their conversation, which was published by Harian Metro.

In the WhatsApp conversation, the Indian Telegram influencer claimed he was from India and said he was interested in promoting the Malaysian cosmetics brand.

Harian Metro also shared that the trend of Indian Telegram influencers seeking brand deals in Malaysia is actually remarkable, as it shows that influencers from India are capable of reaching audiences outside of their home country.

## 🌟 Indian Telegram Influencers are Building Their Following in Malaysia Rapidly

Another local Malaysian news site called Sin Chew Daily interviewed a local Malaysian entrepreneur who owns a transportation company and has a brand deal with an Indian Telegram influencer.

His name is Lim and he told Sin Chew Daily that the Indian Telegram influencer reached out to him via email.

Lim said that the Indian Telegram influencer told him that he has a lot of followers in Malaysia and that he was interested in promoting the Malaysian transportation company.

Lim even shared the screenshot of the email that he received from the Indian Telegram influencer.

In the email, the Indian Telegram influencer, who goes by the name of Akshay Sharma, said he could charge RM 500 for a promotion post and that he has over 200,000 subscribers on Telegram.

Moreover, Lim told Sin Chew Daily that Akshay Sharma had promised to deliver at least 100 leads to the Malaysian transportation company in exchange for his RM 500 fee.

Lim also said that he verified Akshay Sharma's following of over 200,000 subscribers on Telegram and that the Indian Telegram influencer was able to deliver the agreed number of leads.

These leads were contacts of people who were interested in using Lim's transportation company.

What's more, Lim also said that he was able to secure a brand deal with another Indian Telegram influencer for only RM 300.

Additionally, Lim told Sin Chew Daily that he has plans to work with Indian Telegram influencers again in the future due to their effective methods of promoting products and services.

## 🚫 Risks of Working with Indian Telegram Influencers

On the other hand, Malaysian brands and businesses must also be wary of the risks involved in investing in brand deals with Indian Telegram influencers.

For example, a Malaysian TikTok user who goes by the name of Tash told her followers that she installed Telegram for the sole purpose of finding Indian Telegram influencers.

She mentioned that she came across a budding Indian Telegram influencer who goes by the name of Nikhil. 

Tash said that Nikhil contacted her and excitedly told her that he had secured a brand deal with a Malaysian jewelry company called D's Dazzling Jewels.

Nikhil then invited Tash to visit his Telegram channel to watch his promotional video of the jewelry company.

Afterward, Tash checked out the official Telegram channel of Nikhil.

However, she was shocked to find that the Indian Telegram influencer actually posted a pornographic video instead of the promotion video that he promised.

Tash mentioned that she was disappointed and felt like she was tricked into visiting the Indian Telegram influencer's channel.

## 🌟 Why Indian Telegram Influencers are Awesome for Malaysia

According to Marketing in Asia, Indian Telegram influencers can understand the nature of life in Malaysia.

Indian Telegram influencers can relate well to Malaysian audiences, especially Malaysian Indians, because they share similar cultural backgrounds, heritage, and traditions.

Moreover, the fact that Indian Telegram influencers also speak fluent English, which is a primary language in Malaysia, makes it easier for them to communicate with Malaysian audiences.

What's more, Indian Telegram influencers come from India, which is a vibrant country known for its numerous tourist attractions.

Having a brand deal with Indian Telegram influencers can lead to cross-promotional activities for Malaysian brands, where Indian Telegram influencers can attract travelers from India to Malaysia and vice versa.

Not only that, but Indian Telegram influencers can effectively promote Malaysian brands to their large audiences in India who may also be interested in visiting Malaysia.
