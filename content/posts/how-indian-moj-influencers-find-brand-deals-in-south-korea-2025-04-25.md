As a popular Indian platform for short-form videos, Moj has evolved into a significant marketing hub. Thanks to the app's massive user base, many of India‚Äôs hottest influencers are scoring lucrative brand deals in South Korea. 

The prospect of taking their career to the international market is driving Indian influencers to travel all the way to Korea. They are using the homegrown Moj app, where content is created in accordance with the Indian audience, to tap into the lucrative South Korean influencer market.

The content strategy on Moj for these influencers is unique. The short-form videos produced for the South Korean audience are crafted using the app‚Äôs Korean filter. Influencers are discovering that this is the best way to enhance their reach in Korean territories.

## üìà Why Are Indian Influencers Targeting South Korea?

Unlike India, the South Korean market is still relatively untapped by Indian influencers. India and South Korea are relatively close in proximity. South Korea is the home of K-pop, a genre of music that has taken India by storm, particularly among the youth. 

Experts suggest that Indian influencers are using this gap in the market to their advantage by leveraging efforts on Moj, which is a well-known Indian app among the South Korean youth. In addition to the burgeoning popularity of Indian content in South Korea, the nation is witnessing a notable uptick in the adoption of online platforms.

A recent report from the Korea Information Society Development Institute revealed that 92.5 percent of the South Korean population has access to the Internet. This rate surpasses the average of 76 percent across OECD countries. 

Moreover, a report by the Korea Communications Commission indicated that nearly 40% of South Koreans spend more than three hours daily on content consumed through online platforms, which mirrors the situation in India. 

Brands looking to target the Indian market are capitalizing on the extensive online presence of South Koreans. Hence, Indian influencers are capitalizing on this synergy to develop their careers in South Korea.

## üíº What Type of Brand Deals Are Indian Influencers Scoring?

Indian influencers leveraging the Moj app have been rewarded with several lucrative brand deals in South Korea. Popular Indian-based crypto exchanges are among the most common brands that are opting for the Indian influencer route. 

For example, WazirX recently announced a promotional partnership with the famous YouTuber PewDiePie. While PewDiePie has a massive following in South Korea and other parts of the world, he is from Sweden. With the partnership, WazirX was able to create a buzz around its platform. 

The same buzz is what Indian influencers are generating for brands in South Korea. The massive reach that influencers are able to leverage on Moj is making them a worthy marketing tool for brands. 

The Kerala-based 21-year-old influencer Abhirami Narayanan recently bagged a brand collaboration with the popular South Korean skincare brand, AHC. Narayanan has been producing content for AHC since the start of the year. 

The influencer recently disclosed that she was thrilled to land the deal with AHC. She stated that the deal has helped enhance her career beyond India. 

## üé• How Are Indian Influencers Collaborating with Brands?

While influencer marketing is still in its infancy in India, South Korea is ahead of the curve. The latest statistics show that influencer marketing is currently worth more than $1 billion in South Korea.

Here are the standard steps that Indian influencers leverage to secure brand deals with brands in South Korea: 

### Creating Awareness

The first step is establishing oneself as an influencer in the new space. Indian influencers on Moj are doing this by crafting short-form videos that cater to the South Korean audience. 

To bolster their chances of going viral, Indian influencers on Moj have been using the app‚Äôs Korean filter. Utilizing this filter is crucial. From research, it appears that achieving virality on Moj is the best way to enhance one‚Äôs influencer status.

### Reaching Out to Brands

With an established influencer status, the next step is reaching out to brands. Influencers can do this through social media or email.

### Demonstrating Credibility

After reaching out to brands, the next step is proving credibility. Influencers can do this by showcasing their previous work and providing analytics about their audience reach.

### Agreeing on Terms

Once a brand shows interest, the next step is agreeing on the terms. Brands and influencers must ascertain the payment structure, deliverables, and deadlines. 

### Delivering Content

After the terms are agreed upon, the next step is delivering the content. Influencers should ensure that they produce high-quality content that aligns with the brand‚Äôs messaging. 

### Following Up

Once the content is delivered, the last step is following up with the brand. Influencers should check in to see if the brand is satisfied with the content and if there are any additional requirements.

## üí≥ How Are Indian Influencers Getting Paid?

The rise of fintech has transformed India's payment landscape. The majority of Indian influencers are leveraging this transformation to receive payments for brand deals in South Korea.

Gone are the days of long waits for payments. Indian influencers typically receive their payments within a week for brand deals. Especially for those utilizing recent technologies such as blockchain, payments can be received within seconds.

Cryptocurrency is gaining traction in South Korea, making it easier for Indian influencers using crypto marketing platforms to receive payments. An example of such a platform is Emirex, which was founded in 2017 and has grown to become a top-tier cryptocurrency exchange.  Users can leverage it to earn stable and flexible yields on their cryptocurrency holdings.

## üèÜ Is It Working?

Absolutely. The integration of the Korean filter into the app has led to a notable increase in the number of downloads of the app in South Korea.

In fact, according to Sensor Tower,  Moj was the most downloaded app in South Korea in May 2023, surpassing both TikTok and Instagram. 

Moj is reportedly the preferred app in South Korea for editing videos. South Korean users have been flocking to the app to layer music over video clips, a popular trend that has led to its rapid growth in the nation. 

## ‚ùó Advertiser Perspectives

While influencer marketing is popular in South Korea, it is still a relatively recent trend, which means that influencers are still learning the ropes. 

The director of influencer marketing at Hive, a prominent influencer marketing agency in South Korea, advised caution to brands looking to hire Indian influencers. 

The director, who preferred to remain anonymous, disclosed that the influx of Indian influencers could lead to subpar content. Brands should also be wary of scams, especially when it comes to payment. 

## üîö Conclusion

Despite the positive growth in Moj‚Äôs popularity in South Korea, Indian influencers looking to score brand deals in Korea still face several challenges. 

Nevertheless, the growth of the influencer marketing sector in South Korea remains strong. As the demand for creators continues to outpace supply, brands are increasingly turning to the Indian market.
