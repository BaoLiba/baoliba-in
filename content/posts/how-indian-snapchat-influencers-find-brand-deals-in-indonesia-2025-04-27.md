The rise of Snapchat influencers from India has made it easier for brands in Indonesia to make their products or services visible to a wider South Asian clientele.

### üìç South Asian Market 
The Indonesian market is already saturated with influencer marketing. Brands here are well aware that a good marketing strategy on social media can change the trajectory of a business.

However, the position of Indonesia as one of the largest economies in Southeast Asia is a lure for brands outside of the country to step in and tap its potential.

As such, brands from India are now looking at Indonesia as a lucrative market worth investing in.

In order to make this happen, Indian brands are tapping into Indian influencers who have grown a following in Indonesia. 

### üì∏ Snapchat Takes Charge
According to data from 2023, Snapchat boasts a user base with 42% of its active users aged between 18 to 29 years old. This makes Snapchat the preferred social media platform of Gen Z.

This demographic trend can also be seen in Indonesia where 74% of its user base are aged between 15 to 34 years old.

Snapchat is particularly popular in Indonesia as it is the top social platform for Gen Zers.

This makes Snapchat attractive to brands who want to market to the emerging consumer cohort in Indonesia.

For brands in India who want to market to the Indonesian youth, turning to Snapchat influencers proves to be a viable strategy.

### üáÆüá≥ Brands Work with Indian Snapchat Influencers in Indonesia
Indonesia is home to the largest South Asian community in Southeast Asia. Comprising around 3 to 4 million Sri Lankan and Indian nationals, they represent the largest cluster of South Asians in the region.

As such, brands from India can find success marketing their products or services to the South Asian community in Indonesia through influencer marketing.

With Indian influencers already making inroads in Indonesia, they can leverage their following to help Indian brands market their products or services.

Indian brands are looking to Snapchat influencers from India who are already successful in Indonesia to help them sell their products or services.

#### üì¶ Example of a Successful Indonesian Brand Deal
One example of how Indian Snapchat influencers in Indonesia have gotten brand deals from India is the recent collaboration between WhatsHot Media‚Äôs Indian influencer, Sneha Singh and the online grocery shopping app, BigBasket.

With over 30 million downloads and the largest active customer base in India, BigBasket is a household name in India.

BigBasket hired Sneha Singh, a Snapchat influencer from India currently based in Indonesia to perform an ad featuring their services.

As it was uploaded on Snapchat, the ad will be seen by a large audience base of Gen Z users.

In her Snapchat story, Sneha Singh reminds her audience that they can shop for groceries online through BigBasket.

A similar ad can also be found on her Instagram account, where she has 650,000 followers.

#### üáÆüá© Rise of Indian Snapchat Influencers in Indonesia
Bharat Gaur is an Indian Snapchat influencer based in Indonesia. He has amassed a Snapchat following of over 1 million followers.

He moved to Indonesia about 8 years ago and after finding success on Snapchat, he has been able to help other Indian Snapchat influencers succeed in Indonesia.

Bharat has worked with various brands in the country including Titan Watches, Boba Suka, and FNV Fruit Beer.

Bharat shows the level of success that Snapchat influencers from India can have in Indonesia.

He has since helped numerous other Indian Snapchat influencers find their way to success in Indonesia.

This has led to a change in the dynamics of influencer marketing in Indonesia.

### üí∞ Indian Snapchat Influencers Get Paid in Rupiah
Indian brands looking to hire Snapchat influencers in Indonesia will often ask to pay in Indian Rupees. However, most Indian Snapchat influencers based in Indonesia prefer to be paid in Indonesian Rupiah.

This is because they may have to spend on local services or products. Additionally, spending their earnings in their living and working country helps them create a sense of belonging.

This can be considered a common practice in Indonesia.

For example, brands in Indonesia prefer to hire local influencers.

This is because local influencers can offer them the advantage of local knowledge. They also have an affinity with the locals and are often more relatable.

In turn, local influencers in Indonesia may prefer to be paid in Rupiah rather than in the currency of the Indian brand.

### üöÄ How to Work with Indian Snapchat Influencers in Indonesia
Brands in India looking to work with Indian Snapchat influencers based in Indonesia can reach out to them through their Snapchat accounts. 

Alternatively, they can send them a direct message through their Instagram accounts.

They can also reach out to influencer marketing agencies that specialize in the Indonesian market.

Brands should keep in mind that influencers in Indonesia prefer to have a conversation regarding payments through private message.

This allows them to negotiate terms discreetly and avoid other brands trying to hire them at the price of the deal.

Once they have successfully reached out to an Indian Snapchat influencer in Indonesia, they can negotiate the terms of the deal.

Brands should be prepared to send a payment upfront. This is vital for securing the deal.

Once an Indian Snapchat influencer has received the payment, they will then perform the agreed deliverables.

This can include a Snapchat story or a Snapchat post featuring the brand‚Äôs products or services. The same deliverables can also be shared on Instagram.

### ‚ùó Review Safety Measures
Brands should also review the safety measures of the Indian Snapchat influencer they plan to work with. 

This can be done by asking for feedback from their previous brands they have worked with. Alternatively, they can simply look for online reviews about the influencer.

Brands should also do an image check in case the influencer has had a scandal in the past.

This is especially crucial for brands that have a reputation to uphold.

If there are any doubts regarding an Indian Snapchat influencer, then brands are advised to look for another influencer to work with.

### üìä Conclusion
