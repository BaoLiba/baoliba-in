Working with Instagram influencers in Japan has become almost a necessity for brands looking to establish presence in the market. However, with a multitude of factors at play, influencer pricing can be very ambiguous.

While the average cost of collaborating with Japanese Instagram influencers was around 125,000 JPY or 950 USD in 2023, this figure is expected to increase significantly to around 232,000 JPY or 1,710 USD by 2025. 

## 🤳 Understanding the Current Landscape of Instagram Influencers in Japan
Instagram is one of the top social platforms used for influencer marketing in Japan.

With about 100 million Instagram users, 75% of whom are under the age of 35, brands have been quick to recognize the potential the platform offers. And Instagram is just helping brands further capitalize on influencer marketing on their platform.

About 59% of influencer collaborations in Japan occur on Instagram, and according to a study, influencers on the platform earn about 4.2 times more than on other social media platforms.

## 🧭 Instagram Influencer Pricing by Follower Count
When it comes to influencer pricing on Instagram, the follower count is still the most reliable metric for brands. 

In general, the more followers an influencer has, the more they charge. Based on a study by Influence Marketing Hub, the average cost of working with influencers in Japan in 2023 was:

| Follower Count | Average Price (JPY) | Average Price (USD) |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| nano (1k - 10k) | 69,123               | 517                  |
| micro (10k - 100k)| 135,916            | 1,026                |
| mid-tier (100k - 500k)| 404,067          | 3,032                |
| macro (500k - 1M)| 1,086,232           | 8,107                |
| mega (1M or more)| 1,353,844           | 10,130               |
| **Total** | **391,049**         | **2,928**              |

This pricing is expected to increase across the board, with micro and mid-tier influencers seeing the highest percentage increases by 2025.

It's worth noting that even within ranges, pricing is highly variable. For example, some micro influencers charge under 100,000 JPY, while others may charge over 300,000 JPY depending on their niche, audience engagement levels, and other factors.




## 📊 Pricing Based on Engagement
Although follower count is still the main metric used by brands when determining influencer pricing, engagement rate is also taken into account. 

The average price for Instagram influencer collaborations in Japan based on engagement levels in 2023 were:

| Engagement Rate % | Average Price (JPY) | Average Price (USD) |
|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| <0.5%             | 166,762              | 1,251                |
| 0.5% - 1.9%      | 195,438              | 1,459                |
| 2.0% - 5.0%       | 227,469              | 1,706                |
| >5.0%             | 332,490              | 2,498                |
| **Total**         | **391,049**          | **2,928**            |

Clearly, influencers with a high engagement rate are able to command much higher prices.

In 2025, these average prices are expected to be as follows:

| Engagement Rate % | Average Price (JPY) | Average Price (USD) |
|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| <0.5%             | 199,128              | 1,487                |
| 0.5% - 1.9%      | 226,078              | 1,690                |
| 2.0% - 5.0%       | 266,694              | 2,000                |
| >5.0%             | 426,426              | 3,197                |
| **Total**         | **391,049**          | **2,928**            |

## 💼 Pricing Based on Content Type
Another factor that affects pricing for Instagram influencer collaborations is the type of content. 

The main types of content and their corresponding average prices in 2023 were:

| Type of Content  | Average Price (JPY) | Average Price (USD) |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Photo            | 194,774              | 1,463                |
| Carousel         | 305,370              | 2,287                |
| Video            | 257,918              | 1,928                |
| Story            | 136,113              | 1,014                |
| **Total**        | **391,049**          | **2,928**            |

In 2025, the prices are expected to be as follows:

| Type of Content  | Average Price (JPY) | Average Price (USD) |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Photo            | 246,320              | 1,831                |
| Carousel         | 377,592              | 2,834                |
| Video            | 317,893              | 2,363                |
| Story            | 157,744              | 1,168                |
| **Total**        | **391,049**          | **2,928**            |

Carousel posts in particular are set to experience an impressive price increase, making them an attractive option for brands looking to harness the power of storytelling. 

## 💹 Pricing Based on Niche
The influencer niche is another important consideration when it comes to pricing.

Niche influencers are often sought after due to their unique audiences, which usually match the target demographic of brands much more closely. 

As a result, niche influencers can charge much higher prices than general influencers.

In 2023, influencer niches and their corresponding average prices were:

|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|

## ✍ Tips for Brands to Assess Influencer Pricing
Before jumping into negotiations, brands must keep in mind that there’s no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to influencer pricing. 

Influencer pricing can vary significantly depending on multiple factors including niche, engagement, and type of content. 

That said, here are some key points to keep in mind when assessing influencer pricing:

- **Do Thorough Research**: Brands must research expected pricing based on the influencer’s niche, follower count, and engagement rates. This will help brands establish a baseline during negotiations.

- **Establish Clear Goals and KPIs**: Brands should establish clear goals and KPIs before reaching out to influencers. This will allow them to understand what they can expect from the partnership and how it can benefit the influencer.

- **Utilize Influencer Marketing Platforms**: Influencer marketing platforms typically have built-in pricing calculators to help brands assess influencer pricing more accurately. 

- **Don’t Rely on a Single Metric**: Brands should avoid putting too much weight on a single metric when evaluating influencer pricing. Take into account multiple factors including engagement rates, audience demographics, and the influencer’s past performance.

- **Be Prepared for Negotiations**: Brands must be ready to negotiate influencer pricing. Influencers may have their own pricing tiers and factors that justify their rates. Open discussions can lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.

## 🔔 Conclusion
While prices for influencer collaborations in Japan can be high, many brands are still willing to pay the price. 

And with influencer pricing projected to increase over the next couple of years, it’s best for brands to keep an eye on trends in order to maintain a competitive edge.
