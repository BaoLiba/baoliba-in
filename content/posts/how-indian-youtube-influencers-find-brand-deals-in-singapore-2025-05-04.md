In recent years, Singapore has become a hotspot for Indian YouTube influencers seeking for brand deals. With the growth of the Indian diaspora in the city-state, Indian YouTubers have found a lucrative market for securing brand collaborations with products that are appealing to Singaporean Indians.

## üé¨ The Rise of Indian YouTube Influencers

The last decade has witnessed the meteoric rise of Indian YouTube influencers. Today, YouTube has become the most popular social media platform in India, with over 467 million active users, making it the largest user base in the Asia Pacific region and the second largest in the world. With a significant number of these users being under the age of 35, YouTube has become a vital marketing tool for brands seeking to connect with India‚Äôs youth.

According to a report by the Indian Broadcasting Foundation and the global market research firm Nielsen, YouTube is the most frequently used social media platform in India, engaging more than half of its users on the platform at least once a month.

This surge in social media engagement in the country has also resulted in a growing number of individuals trying their hand at becoming influencers. As per a report by Influencer Marketing Factory, India counts over 80 million influencers, the highest number in the world. 

## üá∏üá¨ Expanding Horizons

As the influencer landscape evolves in India, so does the potential for influencers to expand their reach beyond the subcontinent. Due to the increasing number of Indians living abroad, especially in places like Singapore, Indian YouTubers have started focusing on creating content that resonates with the Indian communities in those regions. 

Singapore is one of the most popular destinations for Indians looking to settle abroad, being home to a significant Indian diaspora. According to the 2020 census, Indians make up 9% of Singapore's population, making it the largest ethnic minority group in the city-state.

The extensive Indian community in Singapore has made it easier for Indian YouTubers to penetrate the market. From mukbangs at the famous Banana Leaf Apolo restaurant to vlogs about their experiences living in Singapore, Indian YouTubers are creating content that is more relatable to Singaporean Indians. 

## üìπ How Indian YouTubers Target the Singapore Market

As Indian YouTubers look to create content geared towards Singaporeans, they are also conscious of the business potential in the city-state. 

It is not uncommon for Indian YouTubers to take a trip to Singapore, and much like their Singaporean counterparts, they look to monetize their trips with brand deals. While in the Lion City, Indian YouTubers collaborate with brands that cater to the Indian community and use their influence to market them to their followers and the local community. 

This same formula applies to Singaporean brands looking to collaborate with Indian YouTubers. The brands benefit by gaining exposure and credibility; the influencers get paid, and Singaporean residents get access to the brands they love. 


## üí∏ How Indian Influencers Secure Brand Deals

Indian YouTubers have been able to penetrate the Singaporean influencer marketing scene with the help of influencer marketing agencies. 

Influencer marketing agencies serve as intermediaries between brands and influencers. They are responsible for helping brands connect with influencers that fit their marketing needs. With the growing trend of using influencer marketing to promote products, influencer marketing agencies have become essential tools for brands and influencers alike.

While influencer marketing agencies are primarily used by influencers in their home countries, the agencies that specialize in connecting influencers with brands in Singapore have become an essential part of the marketing strategy for Indian YouTubers looking to penetrate the Singapore market. 

Influencer marketing agencies typically work with a network of influencers who are prequalified for brand deals. They provide a streamlined process for brands to find the right influencer for their campaign. This also includes managing the logistics of the campaign, such as communication between the influencer and the brand, contract negotiation, and payment processing.

In Singapore, influencer marketing agencies like BaoLiba specialize in connecting Indian YouTubers with Singaporean brands. With a network of over 200,000 global influencers, BaoLiba has a dedicated team that helps Indian YouTubers secure lucrative brand collaborations with Singaporean brands.

## üè¶ Payment Methods for Indian YouTubers in Singapore

As Indian YouTubers penetrate the Singapore market, they also have to consider how they will be paid for their brand collaborations. The standard payment methods available in Singapore may not be available to Indian YouTubers.

Brands in Singapore typically use their local currency, the Singapore dollar (SGD), when paying for influencer marketing services. However, for Indian YouTubers, brands may have to consider what payment methods they can use that are accessible to them.

Fortunately, there are many payment methods that Singaporean brands can use that are also accessible to Indian YouTubers. These include wire transfers, Paypal, Payoneer, Wise, and Stripe.
