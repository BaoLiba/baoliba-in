India has a long tradition of friendship with France. With rising Indian influencer power, major brands from France have taken notice and are increasingly courting Indian influencers.  

As they pursue the lucrative European market, Indian YouTube influencers have started making their way into France, searching for lucrative brand deals with popular French brands.  

So, how do Indian YouTube influencers find these brand deals with French companies?  

Let‚Äôs take a look.  

## üé¨ YouTube Influencer Marketing in France  

Globally, YouTube has been on a downward slide in recent years, losing market share to TikTok and Instagram. But, for some reason, France remains a YouTube stronghold.  

In fact, France ranks second only to the U.S. in the number of YouTube users.  

This means that French companies have lots of opportunities to reach their target consumer audience through influencers on YouTube.  

### üéØ Why French Companies Are Courting Indian YouTube Influencers  

Because they value authenticity, Gen-Z consumers are skeptical of advertising. They are less likely to respond positively to traditional marketing and are increasingly turning to social media and influencers for guidance on what to buy.  

The marketing firm, HubSpot, found that 68% of 18- to 24-year-old consumers trust influencers over traditional advertising.  

YouTube influencers are particularly influential. In fact, long-form YouTube video influencers are trusted twice as much as traditional celebrities.  

This is why brands from around the world are increasingly courting influential YouTube creators.  

In France, excitement is brewing over Indian YouTube influencers. French consumers are drawn to Indian culture, and many want to learn about India.  

By partnering with popular Indian YouTube influencers, French brands are able to craft authentic messages that resonate with a growing base of Indian viewers.  

### üåü Popular Indian YouTube Influencers in France  

As they seek out brand deals from prominent French companies, Indian influencers like Ashish Chanchlani and Nisha Guragain are gaining traction in the French influencer market.  

In fact, Indian YouTube influencers have started to emerge as some of the biggest names on YouTube in France.  

In 2023, six of the top ten most popular YouTube influencers in France were Indian.  

In July of this year, the Indian YouTube comedy sensation, Ashish Chanchlani, became the most subscribed French YouTube channel, with over 39 million followers!  

He‚Äôs even more popular than French YouTube comedian and actor, Squeezie, who ranks second with 19.8 million subscribers.  

Nisha Guragain, an Indian Hindi pop singer, ranks third with 19.2 million followers, making her the only musician in the French top ten.  

Following Nisha is the wildly popular Indian dancer, Faisu, with 19.1 million subscribers.  

The other three positions in the French YouTube influencer top ten are also occupied by Indian YouTubers: Jannat Zubair, Aashna Hegde, and Aman Dhattarwal.  

### üí∞ The Allure of Brand Deals with French Companies  

With their ability to drive sales, influencer endorsements are here to stay.  

According to the Indian market research firm, Statista, India‚Äôs influencer marketing industry was worth $1.6 billion in 2022.  

Statista also projects that India‚Äôs influencer marketing industry will grow to $3.7 billion by 2025. In other words, the industry is on track to nearly double in size in just three years!  

India-based influencers are driving this growth as they gain popularity among brands both locally and globally.  

Still, while Indian YouTube influencers are able to drive sales among Indian consumers, they are still competing for brand deals with thousands of other Indian influencers.   

This puts Indian influencers who want to stay competitive against their peers in a precarious position, as they need to go where the demand is greater...which means going global.  

### üåè The Need for Indian YouTube Influencers to Go Global  

Indian influencer marketing agency, FNGG, reported that in 2023, 64% of Indian influencers have global aspirations, with France being a top target market.  

As a global influencer marketing agency based in India, BaoLiba is seeing first-hand how Indian influencers are increasingly courting global brands.  

According to BaoLiba, France is becoming a top target for Indian YouTube influencers because of the high demand for Indian culture and Indian cultural representation among French consumers.  

According to Indian YouTube influencer marketing expert, Leo Patel, Indian YouTube influencers are finding new opportunities abroad, especially since international brands are willing to pay a premium for their services.  

Patel noted that the French influencer market is different from India‚Äôs. He explained that French brands are willing to pay up to 3 times more than Indian brands for an influencer marketing campaign.  

### üöÄ How Indian YouTube Influencers are Finding Brand Deals in France  

So, how are Indian YouTube influencers finding brand deals in France?  

The answer is that they're partnering with French influencer marketing agencies.  

Like in India, French influencer marketing agencies have established connections with local brands, allowing them to connect and collaborate with influencers from around the world.  

Besides having established connections with local brands, French influencer marketing agencies help Indian YouTube influencers navigate the intricacies of the French influencer market.  

For example, influential Indian YouTubers who want to work with French brands don‚Äôt have to learn French to communicate because influencer marketing agencies serve as translators.  

According to influencer marketing agencies, the process for Indian YouTube influencers to find brand deals with French companies is simple.  

### üìù Finding Brand Deals in France through French Agencies  

1. **The French influencer marketing agency reaches out to the Indian influencer.**   
French influencer marketing agencies are actively recruiting Indian YouTube influencers. They are also reaching out to leading influencer marketing agencies in India to find Indian YouTube influencers who might be a good fit for French brand deals. They are doing this via email, social media, and messenger apps like WhatsApp.  
2. **The French influencer marketing agency introduces the Indian influencer to potentials brands.**   
Once an Indian YouTube influencer has agreed to work with a French influencer marketing agency, the agency‚Äôs first step is to introduce the influencer to brands interested in an endorsement. The agency‚Äôs experience and connections with local brands is a big advantage that helps them find lucrative brand deals for the influencer.  
3. **The French influencer marketing agency negotiates the deal on behalf of the Indian influencer.**   
Due to cultural differences, French brands don‚Äôt always communicate directly with influencers in the same way as Indian brands do. Therefore, French influencer marketing agencies act as intermediaries. Also, because French brands tend to pay much more than Indian brands for influencer marketing campaigns, negotiating the amount brands will pay influencers is often more complex. French influencer marketing agencies have the connections and experience to handle these negotiations on behalf of Indian influencers.    
4. **The Indian influencer creates content to promote the brand.**   
After the deal is struck between the influencer and the brand, the Indian influencer creates content to promote the brand.  
5. **The French influencer marketing agency ensures that the influencer is paid by the brand.**   
Once the content is completed, the French influencer marketing agency delivers the content to the brand for approval. After the brand approves the content, the agency publishes it. The agency also makes sure the Indian influencer is paid, as well.  

### üîç Where to Find French Influencer Marketing Agencies
