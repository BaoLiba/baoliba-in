With over 300 million monthly active users, ShareChat has become one of the most popular social media platforms in India. Tapping into Indian culture, ShareChat features content in over 15 different native languages and has gained a loyal following among urban and rural Indians alike.

However, what many people don‚Äôt know is that the app has also become a legitimate platform for Indian influencers to obtain brand deals in Malaysia.

Indian influencers are now actively reaching out to both Malaysian brands and Indian brands that have a presence in Malaysia for potential collaborations.

Although there isn‚Äôt substantial data on why this is happening, many close to the industry speculate that the influx of Indian migrants in Malaysia has created a sense of familiarity among Indian influencers to that particular market. As a result, Malaysian brands may perceive Indian influencers as a better option when it comes to targeting the Indian market.

In this article, we will look at why Indian influencers prefer ShareChat to other platforms, the potential that exists in Malaysia for Indian influencers, and how to reach out to Malaysian brands for sponsorships.


## üìä Why ShareChat?

While Instagram and TikTok are globally regarded as the go-to platforms for influencers, there are a few aspects of ShareChat that resonate with the Indian diaspora‚Äôs social media experience. 

On a surface level, the design of ShareChat is reminiscent of Facebook of old; a platform that prioritizes posts of personal experience over superficial aesthetics. 

ShareChat also has a plethora of features that may seem redundant to those used to Western platforms, but strike a chord with users who are familiar with the sheer amount of content churned out by the Indian internet.

It is also important to note that this is the app of choice for rural Indians; a significant demographic that has yet to fully realize its social media potential. Given that the Malaysian Indian community is mostly comprised of lower-income migrant laborers, the insight that can be gleaned by connecting with this community through a familiar platform could be justified.


## üì¢ The Indian Market in Malaysia

Official census records show that Indians comprise about 6.3% of Malaysia‚Äôs population. The Indian diaspora in Malaysia is mostly made up of Tamil-speaking people who are descendants of indentured labourers brought in by the British my government initiatives during the colonial period.

While Malaysians of Indian descent have established themselves in various sectors such as the corporate world, education, and the arts, many Indians in Malaysia are still low-income laborers.

It is estimated that there are over 1.7 million Indians living in Malaysia, with nearly 80% of them residing in peninsular Malaysia. 

According to a report conducted by the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs (Ideas) and the Malaysian Institute for Economic Research (Mier) back in 2020, Indian communities in Malaysia face some of the worst socio-economic challenges in the country.

Despite possessing a majority in terms of human resources, Malaysian Indians have a median monthly income of RM 2,779 (USD 605), which is significantly lower than the national average of RM 3,400 (USD 748). 

Similarly, only 4% of Malaysian Indians are actively involved in the economy compared to the majority ethnic Malay population, where 20% of the population is involved in business and entrepreneurship.

As it stands, Malaysian Indians are still considered an economically disadvantaged minority.

In short, the potential for tapping into this community exists ‚Äì and Malaysian brands, especially those that seek to attract lower-income markets, would do well to engage with the Indian community through influencers who are able to accurately portray their experiences.


## üìä Reaching Out to Malaysian Brands

While many influencers have their unique methods of getting brand deals, it is important that you have a general framework that you can follow.

Here are some points to consider when working with Malaysian brands: 

#### 1. Use Malaysian Rupees

When it comes to pricing your collaborations with Malaysian brands, be sure to use Malaysian ringgit (RM). Not only does this convey professionalism on your part, but it also makes it easier for brands to understand your expectations.

Most Malaysian brands will not be used to dealing with Indian influencers. As such, using your local currency shows them that you are familiar with the Malaysian market, and helps establish you as a trusted partner.

Make sure to do your homework on the conversion rates so you don‚Äôt underprice your services, or inflate your prices out of greed. 

#### 2. Use Local Platforms to Connect

While ShareChat is a great platform to use for your pitch, you can also connect with Malaysian brands through platforms that are more widely used in Malaysia. 

For example, WhatsApp is the main messaging platform used in Malaysia. As such, reach out to local brands on WhatsApp to pitch your idea. 

Facebook and Instagram are also more widely used in Malaysia compared to their Indian counterparts. You can also use LinkedIn to connect with corporate brands.

Do your research and approach the right people. Try to connect with marketing companies that already have an established relationship with influencers, as they will be much easier to work with.

#### 3. Highlight Your Malaysia Strategy

When approaching brands, make sure to highlight how you plan to represent their products in Malaysia. 

Malaysia is a multicultural country, and the Indian community is only one of the three major ethnic groups in the country, alongside ethnic Malays and Chinese. 

Be sure to inform brands of your target audience. Are you aiming for Indian tourists or locals? Is your focus on middle class Indians in urban centres, or low-income migrants from Tamil Nadu?

Additionally, be sure to mention that your focus will be on the Indian community in Malaysia. This is vital, as it establishes your credibility as a ShareChat influencer and demonstrates to the brand that you can accurately portray the cultural aspects of their products.

Be prepared to answer any questions they may have regarding your Malaysian strategy. The more you know about the local market, the more trust you can develop with the brand.

#### 4. Consider the Bigger Picture

While making money through brands deals is great, it is important that you also consider the bigger picture. 

Malaysian Indian communities are often overlooked by many brands. Your unique position as an Indian influencer allows you to elevate the lives of your community, and extend the goodwill of brands into areas where they would otherwise not be able to penetrate.

When pitching brands, convey to them how they can benefit from their partnership with you, and how they can give back to the Indian community in Malaysia.

Be sure to come up with creative ideas on how to involve their products in community initiatives, welfare programs, and brand campaigns that highlight the Indian community in Malaysia.

The Malaysian Indian welfare foundation is just one of many organizations that seek to improve the socio-economics of the Indian diaspora in Malaysia. Creating partnerships with local charities can go a long way to elevating both your profile and the lives of Indian communities in Malaysia.
