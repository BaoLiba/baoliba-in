In recent years, Indian influencers have flocked to ShareChat, a homegrown social media platform that has gained immense popularity among users across the country.  

With its unique features tailored to local tastes, ShareChat has become a vital tool for influencers seeking to build their brands. And the best part? Creators can reach audiences far beyond Indian borders, as many influencers are now seeking brand deals in international markets.  

One place where Indian ShareChat influencers have found significant success in sourcing brand partnerships is in the Netherlands.  

But how does this work? 

From knowing when to wake up for meetings to how to get paid in rupees, here‚Äôs a guide for Indian ShareChat influencers looking to score brand deals in the Netherlands.  

## üìä Why Are Dutch Brands Looking to Partner with Indian ShareChat Influencers?  

As the Netherlands boasts a strong economy, Dutch marketers are looking to invest in marketing strategies that tap into new and diverse markets, including India.  

According to the latest figures from Statistics Netherlands, the Dutch economy grew by 6.5 percent in 2021, one of the highest growth rates in Europe.  

Another reason marketers from Holland are interested in teaming up with Indian influencers is that India has one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, with a nominal GDP of $3.9 trillion in 2022, according to the World Bank.  

Meanwhile, an article on the Dutch news site, DutchReview, highlighted that the Indian diaspora is the fastest-growing ethnic group in the Netherlands, with the number of people from the Indian subcontinent who have settled in the Netherlands increasing from 370,000 in 2011 to 490,000 in 2021.  

It is estimated that the number of Indians residing in the Netherlands will exceed a million by 2025, making them the largest ethnic community in the country.  

This gesture signifies a lasting relationship between India and the Netherlands, and with the rise of India‚Äôs economy and the influence of niche communities in the Netherlands, Indian ShareChat influencers can expect to receive more inquiries from Dutch brands.  

## üí° Which Niche Markets Should Indian ShareChat Influencers Approach?  

Although brand deals can come from various industries, Indian ShareChat influencers should target specific niche markets that are more likely to yield fruitful partnerships with Dutch brands.  

### ü©¥ Fashion       

The Netherlands is known for its unique fashion sense that reflects both Dutch culture and contemporary trends.   

Fashion brands that focus on sustainability, ethical production methods, and innovative designs are particularly popular.   

Indian ShareChat influencers can attract Dutch fashion brands by showcasing Indian attire and fabrics, or by adopting a fusion style combining Western and Indian elements.  

### üè≠ Manufacturing  

The Netherlands has a prominent industrial sector, with Dutch brands well-known for their high-quality machinery and equipment.   

Indian ShareChat influencers can attract brand deals from Dutch manufacturing companies, especially B2B brands, by demonstrating how their products have made a positive impact in India.   

### üå± Sustainable Green Technologies  

The Netherlands is at the forefront of sustainable and eco-friendly innovation, and there is a growing demand for green technologies in India.   

As Indian ShareChat influencers showcase their commitment to sustainability through their content, they can attract partnerships with Dutch brands specializing in solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles.  

By partnering with influencers who prioritize sustainability in their work, Dutch brands can effectively position themselves in the Indian market.   

### üçª Food and Beverage  

Dutch brands in the food and beverage industry, especially those with an emphasis on organic, vegan, or health-conscious products, are increasingly interested in partnering with Indian influencers.   

By leveraging their unique perspectives, Indian ShareChat influencers can showcase how Dutch food products can be part of an Indian lifestyle.   

This allows Indian audiences to discover new flavors while enabling Dutch brands to effectively reach the Indian market.   

## üõ´ What is the Best Time for Indian ShareChat Influencers to Contact Dutch Brands?  

Indian ShareChat influencers should be mindful of the time difference when attempting to contact Dutch brands about securing a brand deal.  

The Netherlands is 4.5 hours behind India, and this time change means that Indian influencers should aim to contact brands in Holland in the late afternoon or early evening if they want a prompt response.  

This is because the best time to contact brands is when they are open and in the office.  

Indian ShareChat influencers may also want to consider hosting a meeting with a Dutch brand at their local time of 10 AM in the Netherlands, which translates to 2.30 PM in India.   

This way, they are not waking up at the crack of dawn to meet a brand, nor are they wrapping up an exhausting day of work to meet a brand at their local time of 10 PM.    

## üí≥ What Payment Method Should Indian ShareChat Influencers Use?  

A significant challenge when securing a brand deal overseas is getting paid, especially if the influencer lives in a different country and operates using a different currency.  

Dutch brands may offer to pay Indian ShareChat influencers in euros, which is not ideal when the influencer‚Äôs expenses are in rupees.  

To address this concern, Indian ShareChat influencers can request that they get paid in their local currency.   

With the help of a reputable international payment platform, they can receive funds in euros and exchange them for rupees at a favorable rate.  

One great option is Wise, a payment platform that boasts a low conversion fee and provides a borderless account with local bank details in various currencies, including euros.  

### ‚úÖ Benefits of Using Wise  

- **Low Fees**: Using the real exchange rate, Wise charges only a small fee to convert your euros into rupees.  

- **Fast Transfers**: Transfers can take just a few hours, and most are completed by the next business day.  

- **Flexible**: You can hold euros in your Wise account to send to your Indian bank account when the exchange rate is most favorable.  

- **Local Bank Details**: With Wise, you can operate like a local in 10 currencies and receive money in 30 currencies without needing a bank account in every country.  

### üåç Other International Payment Platforms  

While Wise is one of the best international payment platforms for Indian influencers, there are other options to consider, including:  

- **PayPal**: A widely-used platform that facilitates easy international transfers, although fees can be higher than with some other services.  

- **Payoneer**: A popular choice for freelancers and businesses, allowing users to receive payments in multiple currencies.  

- **Skrill**: Offers international transfers, prepaid debit cards, and low fees, making it a flexible option for influencers.  

## ‚ùó What Should Indian ShareChat Influencers Watch Out for?  

When communicating or finalizing a brand deal with a Dutch company, Indian ShareChat influencers should be wary of falling victim to scams.  

While scams can happen anywhere, some scams are more prevalent in certain regions or countries than others.  

### üì© Email Scams  

One common type of scam that Indian ShareChat influencers should be aware of is the Email Scam.  

In this scam, the influencer is offered a lucrative brand deal over email, and once the influencer expresses interest, they are sent a check worth several times the amount they were promised or worth several times more than what they usually charge for a brand deal.  

The scammer will then instruct the influencer to cash the check and wire a portion of that money to the scammer‚Äôs account.   

The influencer may think they have just secured a generous brand deal and completed a cash transfer, but they will soon discover that the check was fake.  

Once the influencer informs their bank that the check bounced or was fraudulent, they will be on the hook for the entire amount.  

### üí≤ Fees to Receive the Payment  

Another type of scam that Indian ShareChat influencers should look out for is the Payment Fee Scam.  

In this variant of the Email Scam, the influencer is tasked with sending a certain product to the scammer or brand‚Äôs address before the funds are transferred.  

Once the influencer agrees, they are informed that they need to pay a fee to receive the payment.   

The fee could be anything from transfer fees to a fraudulent tax.  

After paying the fee, the influencer will soon find that they have not received the payment or the product they sent has not been returned.  

### ü§µ Fake Profiles  

Lastly, Indian ShareChat influencers should be wary of Fake Profiles.  

Sometimes, scammers will create a fake account using a real Dutch brand‚Äôs name and ask influencers to reach out to them if they are interested in a brand deal.  

Once the influencer contacts the scammer, they will ask the influencer to provide personal information, such as their home address or financial information.  

These scammers may even go so far as to ask the influencer to pay a deposit or fee to receive their payment after the partnership is complete.  

### ‚úÖ How to Avoid Scams  

To avoid falling victim to scams, Indian ShareChat influencers can do the following:  

- **Check Email Addresses**: Ensure that emails are from the official domain, not a free email service.  

- **Research**: Search for reviews or warnings about the brand or individual offering the deal.   

- **Trust Your Instincts**: If something feels off or too good to be true, it probably is.   

- **Use Secure Payment Methods**: Opt for payment methods that offer some form of buyer or seller protection.  

- **Communicate via Official Channels**: Whenever possible, use official communication channels (like a brand‚Äôs verified social media page) to confirm offers.  

## üì¢ Conclusion  

With the rise of ShareChat, many Indian influencers are searching for brand deals abroad.  

By showcasing the strength of Indian creativity and craftsmanship, Indian ShareChat influencers can position themselves as valuable partners for Dutch brands looking to enter or expand their presence in India.  

As one of the largest ethnic communities in the Netherlands, Indian ShareChat influencers are uniquely positioned to help Dutch brands effectively navigate the Indian market and reach their target audience.
