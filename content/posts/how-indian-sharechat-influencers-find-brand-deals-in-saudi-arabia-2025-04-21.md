Sudan, Saudi Arabia: The untold story of Indian influencers from ShareChat joining hands with local brands is captivating.

The grassroots social media platform, which hosts the largest body of Indian influencers and creators, is said to be witnessing its users successfully transition to the Middle Eastern influencer ecosystem.

Reports from the influencers reveal that they have been able to capitalize on the affinity that the local population has for Indian culture in terms of food, music, and fashion.

## 🌍 Why Saudi Arabia?

Recent studies show that Indian culture ranks as the most popular among the local populace, with the people of Saudi Arabia indulging in Indian movies and songs the most.

As such, Indian influencers are able to entertain and captivate the local populace with their relatable content.

The fact that they also speak the local dialect makes it easy for Indian influencers to strike quick brand deals with local businesses.

The Saudi people view Indian influencers as relatives, which creates a unique familial bond that transcends ordinary consumerism. 

## 📈 The Numbers

Social media marketing has seen immense growth across the Middle East, growing 47 percent since 2021. 

Globally, it was also reported that the influencer marketing industry is expected to be worth $16.4 billion in 2023. 

The numbers indicate that the Saudi influencer marketing ecosystem is still very much in its infancy, opening up a plethora of opportunities for savvy Indian influencers to penetrate the ecosystem.

## 🏆 How Are Influencers Making The Leap?

A typical ShareChat influencer in India is a local hero, commanding a significant following. 

These influencers are renowned for their crafted videos that entertain millions with relatable humor, comedy skits, and remixes - like music videos that feature trending songs and mainstream movie tracks.

The best part is that ShareChat influencers are able to pull off brand deals for as low as 10,000 rupees.

The skills acquired through these low-budget deals make it easy for Indian influencers to adapt to the Saudi influencer marketing ecosystem. 

## 💵 Payment Platforms

As ShareChat influencers have made the leap into Saudi Arabia, they have also had to become acquainted with the local payment processes that differ from those in India. 

The Indian influencer scene typically relies on bank deposits, PayPal, and UPI for payments. However, brands in Saudi Arabia rely heavily on different platforms for financial transactions.

According to several reports, Saudi brands have been using local payment platforms like HyperPay, Paymob, and Tap Payments to send payments to Indian influencers.

These platforms allow brands to conduct more than one type of transaction, whether a one-time purchase or a subscription to a recurring payment plan.

The larger Saudi brands have also used traditional financing methods, like direct deposits into the influencers' bank accounts.

## ❗ Changes Coming

Online influencers in Saudi Arabia may soon be required to obtain licenses to operate. 

The Saudi Ministry of Information published a notice in the second half of September 2023 announcing the launch of a licensing mechanism to regulate the industry amid a sharp rise in influencers across social media platforms.

It remains unclear how these new regulations may impact the rising number of Indian influencers entering the Saudi influencer marketing scene.

The influx of Indian influencers into Saudi Arabia will likely work to help Saudi brands obtain their licenses if they can promise to help the brands obtain them.

## ✅ Conclusion

Indeed, the global influencer marketing ecosystem is becoming more interconnected with each passing day. 

Indian influencers on ShareChat are going to continue to break down regional barriers, opening up the entire Middle East for their fellow influencers back home. 

Whether the Indian influencers can manage these rapid changes remains to be seen, but their unity and culture suggest that they can.
