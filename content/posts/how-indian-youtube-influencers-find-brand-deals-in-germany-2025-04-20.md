Despite high-profile Indian YouTube influencers like BB Ki Vines and Ashish Chanchlani pushing envelopes for the Indian YouTube community on a mass scale, they are hardly ever enough.

Over the last couple of years, a growing breed of Indian YouTube influencers are realizing the untapped potential of the German influencer marketing landscape and venturing into it. From the looks of it, this trend is here to stay.

But how do Indian YouTube influencers create a name for themselves in Germany? 

## 📖 The Why

In a nutshell, the influencer marketing industry in India is at saturation point. Competition is high, entry is easy, and brands are spending less. Of the issues that influencers are facing, the bane of working with Indian brands is funding.

Most Indian brands are ever-ready to capitalize on the attention influencers can bring to them but often lack the financial windfall to get what they seek. While most influencers charge between ₹25,000 and ₹100,000 ($300 to $1,200) per video, brands are reluctant to shell out more than ₹10,000 ($120) for them.

In comparison, Germany has a flourishing influencer marketing industry. A recent report from the leading marketing and advertising firm, Statista, highlighted that half of all marketing professionals in Germany believe that influencer marketing will grow in importance in 2025, and Reddit is Germany’s favorite platform for influencer marketing.

Furthermore, influencers can charge more money than their Indian counterparts and receive faster payments.

## 🔍 The Search

Germany-based promotional service providers and agencies like influencer marketing agency, 21st Century INFLUENCER GMBH, and Manage Your Influencer have made it easy for Indian YouTube influencers to find brand deals in Germany.

Platforms like Teemill and Cakemoji are helping influencers monetize their reach by allowing them to sell products and merchandise while brands are leveraging influencers’ popularity to grow their own.

While in the past, Indian influencers would have to partner with brands like the aforementioned platforms to get any sort of engagement, the recent boom in their popularity has helped level the international playing field.

Indian YouTube influencers are now connecting with German brands and service providers on popular networking and project management platforms like LinkedIn and Upwork. 

## 💳 The Transaction

With India and Germany being two parts of the world that are as far apart as they can get, the question of how Indian YouTube influencers get paid for their brand collaborations in Germany looms large.

While some might think that the age-old use of banker’s cheques could be enough to settle the financial aspect of Indian influencers working in Germany, PayPal is far more trustworthy than a banker’s cheque.

PayPal can make it easier for German brands and service providers to pay Indian influencers for their content and advertisements, due to its widespread acceptance. Furthermore, influencers can convert their payments into INR at the current exchange rate via PayPal.

Indian influencers are using this advantage to their benefit.

“PayPal is an e-commerce platform many German companies use to receive payments online,” stated Karan Raj, a successful influencer from Maharashtra who had worked with influencer marketing firms in Germany before breaking into the market on his own.

“Many influencer marketing agencies in Germany pay Indian influencers directly through PayPal. I have also received payments from German brands for promotional posts on my YouTube channel and my Instagram account using PayPal.” 

“Germany is open to international talent,” says Raj. “I have been fortunate enough to work with a few brands from the country and they always paid me via PayPal,” he added.

In addition to PayPal, Indian influencers can also use other remittance platforms like Wise and Western Union to move their payments from Germany to India.

## 📱 The Presentation 

Apart from influencer marketing service providers, payments platforms, and finance remittance firms, the social media platforms themselves are also behind the success of Indian YouTube influencers in Germany.

In fact, many influencers are there for the same reason content creators from all around the world go where they are welcome and valued — the opportunity to grow.

Unlike Indian social media platforms that often stifle creators, platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok are more welcoming of all creators and provide them better tools to connect with their audiences.

Social media has effectively crumbled the age-old walls businesses and brands had built up around them that kept consumers at a distance. Today, consumers want to feel valued by brands and engage with them personally.

“YouTube is a platform where I can share what is happening in my life, directly with my fans,” said Raj. “They can comment, and express their opinions. I can even reply to them. This level of interaction is new to Indian audiences, and that’s why they are responding more positively to foreign brands.”

Distant audiences become closer when a brand gets comfortable working with influencers. Consumers form emotional connections with brands that are comfortable using influencers to spread their messages, and they are more likely to engage with them.

## 🎞️ The Goal 

These days, German brands and service providers are looking for new influencers like never before. The tech-based foundation of Germany’s economy means that the country has an insatiable appetite for digital advertising.

It is this appetite that Indian YouTube influencers are leveraging to present their content to German audiences. 

While influencers like Raj can be seen working with German brands like 21st Century INFLUENCER GMBH to promote their influencer marketing services and tools, others like Steve Babu are working with German brands directly.

Babu, who is based out of Pune, creates videos showcasing his authentic German cooking skills and lifestyle on YouTube and Instagram. His German audience loves his Indian-style Gebäck and Spaghetti, as well as his authentic Swabian Maultaschen.

“People love my Maultaschen and Spaghetti. I am also known for my delicious German cakes,” he stated in response to a query on his YouTube channel. “If someone from Germany would like to get in touch with me, my contact details are in the About section of my channel,” he added.

The fact is that Indian YouTube influencers are doing more than just creating a name for themselves in Germany. They are paving the way for future content creators from India to find fortune abroad.
