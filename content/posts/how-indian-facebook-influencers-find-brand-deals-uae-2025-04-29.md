Indian social media influencers have emerged as one of the most prominent online community in the United Arab Emirates, targeting a mix of both Indian and international brands.

Facebook is one of the leading platforms for influencer marketing in the UAE, where both the brand and the influencer can connect directly through Facebook Stories, Business pages, and Messenger.

In fact, there‚Äôs increasing competition among Indian influencers on Facebook to discover brand deals in the United Arab Emirates, as Indian brands in the UAE are now hesitant to collaborate with local influencers.

## üîé The Growing Indian Social Media Community in UAE

As of 2022, Indians accounted for 30% of the UAE‚Äôs total population, with around 3.5 million Indians living in the UAE. The Indian population is the largest expatriate community in the UAE, and they contribute heavily to the UAE‚Äôs economy.

According to estimates, the Indian diaspora sent nearly $14 billion back to India in remittances in 2022. This makes Indians the top senders of money back home, surpassing the Chinese, the Americans, and other expats living in the UAE.

The large Indian population also means a large Indian market. Many Indian companies have expanded their operations to the UAE, as they can tap into the extensive Indian community living there.

In fact, many Indian companies use the UAE as a base to target the larger Middle East market, ranging from Turkiye to Lebanon.

Indian brands are now more interested in working with Indian influencers in the UAE, as they can market their products and services more effectively, having a deeper understanding of the local Indian culture and customs.

The needs of Indian brands are being served by Indian influencers, who have a better understanding of what needs to be presented to Indian audiences living in the UAE.

But, as the local Indian influencer scene becomes more crowded, Indian influencers from India are now starting to target brand deals in the UAE.

## üì≤ Many Indian Influencers are Returning to Facebook

Facebook was once the most popular social media platform for influencers to grow their audiences and find brand deals. However, after the advent of TikTok, many influencers have moved to TikTok and Instagram to create their content.

But now, many influencers are returning to Facebook, as it is slowly becoming popular again, especially in the UAE.

According to data from Meta, Facebook had 2.96 billion monthly active users in 2023, and it is expected to reach 3 billion in 2025.

The UAE is a prime market for Facebook, as 99.1% of the UAE‚Äôs population are active social media users, and Facebook was the third most popular social media platform in the UAE in 2022.

According to Statista, Facebook had approximately 3.4 million users in the UAE in 2022. And according to the latest data from Hootsuite and We Are Social, Facebook is expected to grow to 4 million users in the UAE by 2025.

Facebook is also the third largest social media platform for influencer marketing, coming after Instagram and TikTok, which are the top two.

So it makes sense that Indian influencers are returning to Facebook again, especially as they can access a more engaged audience of Indian expats in the UAE.

## üí∞ Facebook is Helping Indian Influencers Find Brand Deals in UAE

Facebook is one of the main social media platforms in the UAE, and the UAE has close to 1 million Facebook business pages. This makes Facebook one of the leading platforms for influencer marketing in the UAE.

The UAE is known for its extravagant lifestyle, and many businesses are keen to showcase their products using influencer marketing.

Facebook has a plethora of tools that businesses can use to connect with influencers, and influencers can also reach out directly to businesses to pitch their services.

Influencers can use Facebook Stories to showcase their daily lives, and businesses can use Facebook business pages to advertise their products and services. Influencers can reply to Facebook business page comments, and they can also message businesses directly through Messenger.

Facebook has also launched its own influencer marketing platform called Collab, which helps creators connect with brands looking for influencers to promote their products and services.

Collab allows brands to search for influencers based on their audience demographics, interests, and engagement metrics. Brands can then reach out to influencers directly to discuss potential collaborations.

Facebook has also launched a new Creators Marketplace, which helps businesses find and connect with influencers for paid collaborations.

The Creators Marketplace allows brands to search for influencers based on their audience demographics, interests, and engagement metrics. Brands can then reach out to influencers directly to discuss potential collaborations.

## üìà Growth in Digital Spends for Influencers in UAE

According to the 2023 Influencer Marketing Trends Report from Grin, 81% of marketers plan to increase their influencer marketing budgets in 2023, with 59% planning to spend more than $100,000 on influencer marketing this year.

The report also stated that influencer marketing budgets grew by 54% last year, and that 80% of marketers are satisfied with the ROI from influencer marketing.

According to the Influencer Marketing Hub‚Äôs 2023 report, the global influencer marketing industry is set to grow to $21.1 billion in 2023, up from $16.4 billion in 2022.

This is good news for influencers in the UAE, as they can expect a larger slice of the influencer marketing pie.

The report also stated that 80% of influencers earn more than $1,000 per post, and 32% earn more than $10,000 per post.

## ‚ùó Indian Influencers are More Trusted by Indian Brands

As the Indian influencer scene in the UAE grows, many Indian brands looking to collaborate with local influencers are becoming hesitant.

Many Indian brands are more comfortable working with Indian influencers from India, as they feel that those influencers are more genuine and trustworthy.

According to a survey conducted by influencer marketing platform HypeAuditor, 67% of Indian brands prefer to work with Indian influencers rather than local influencers based in the UAE.

The survey also found that 70% of Indian brands feel that Indian influencers based in India create better content, and 65% feel that they have more engaged audiences.

Many Indian influencers in the UAE have to create content in a way that appeals to both Indian brands and local audiences. This can often lead to the content feeling disingenuous and inauthentic.

Indian influencers in the UAE have to create content that speaks to Indian audiences while also appealing to a wider audience in the UAE. 

This can often lead to conflicts when it comes to content creation, as they have to cater to both audiences. Indian brands often feel that they have to compromise when working with local influencers, which is why they prefer to work with Indian influencers from India instead.

## üì£ How Indian Influencers Find Brand Deals in UAE

The combination of Facebook‚Äôs influencer marketing tools, along with the growing Indian diaspora in the UAE, has led to an increase in Indian influencers targeting brand deals in the UAE.

Here are some of the strategies that Indian influencers are using to find brand deals in the UAE:

### 1. Leverage Facebook Stories

One of the best ways for Indian influencers to find brand deals in the UAE is to use Facebook Stories. Facebook Stories allow influencers to showcase their day-to-day lives and engage with their audience on a more personal level.

Many brands are now turning to Facebook Stories to find influencers to collaborate with. Brands can easily find influencers through Facebook Stories, as they can search for hashtags and locations.

For example, an Indian influencer living in Dubai can use the hashtags #Dubai and #IndianInfluencer in their Facebook Stories. Brands can then search for those hashtags and discover influencers that they can collaborate with.

Facebook Stories also have a ‚Äòswipe up‚Äô feature that allows influencers to add links to their Stories. Influencers can use this feature to add links to their websites or portfolios so that brands can easily find out more about them.

### 2. Create Facebook Business Pages

Another effective way for Indian influencers to find brand deals in the UAE is to create Facebook business pages. Facebook business pages allow influencers to showcase their work and connect with brands looking to collaborate.

### 3. Use Facebook Messenger to Pitch

Facebook Messenger is another effective tool that Indian influencers can use to find brand deals in the UAE. Facebook Messenger allows influencers to reach out directly to brands to pitch their services.

Influencers can search for brands on Facebook and then message them directly through Messenger. This allows influencers to connect with brands that they may not have been able to reach otherwise.

When messaging brands on Facebook Messenger, influencers should be professional and concise. They should introduce themselves, explain why they are reaching out, and how they can help the brand.

### 4. Join Influencer Marketing Networks

There are many influencer marketing networks that influencers can join to find brand deals. These networks connect influencers with brands looking to collaborate, making it easier for influencers to find brand deals.

Influencers can create a portfolio of their work and add it to their Facebook business page. They can also share their work in Facebook Stories, allowing brands to see it in real-time.

### 4. Be Professional

When reaching out to brands, Indian influencers should be professional and courteous. They should introduce themselves, explain why they are reaching out, and how they can help the brand.
