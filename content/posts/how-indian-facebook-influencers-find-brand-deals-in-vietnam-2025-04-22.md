When it comes to influencer marketing, Facebook isn't a one-dimensional platform.

Unlike Instagram and TikTok, on which influencer marketing still primarily hinges on feed posts, Facebook has truly developed a multi-dimensional system for influencer marketing.

From humorous skits and unboxing videos to music videos and product reviews, the Indian Facebook influencer ecosystem is remarkably diverse. 

One of the most compelling aspects of this ecosystem is that a growing number of Indian influencers are landing brand deals with Vietnamese companies!

Through Facebook, they are deftly navigating the geography of boundaries and language to find opportunities in unfamiliar territory.

With that in mind, let's explore how Indian influencers are leveraging Facebook to find lucrative collaborations with Vietnamese brands.

## ðŸ’¡How Do Indian Influencers Find Brand Deals in Vietnam?

To find brand deals, Indian creators primarily utilize Facebook groups. 

This 'Facebook First' mentality differentiates Indian influencers from their counterparts in other countries in Asia. 

To explain further, in countries like Thailand, South Korea, and Japan, influencers often use Instagram and TikTok as their primary networking platforms to find brand partnerships. 

But according to a 2023 survey of Indian influencers conducted by influencer marketing platform Baoliba, 93% of Indian influencers are active in Facebook groups.

This focus on Facebook has allowed them to thrive in Vietnam, which for the most part has not moved beyond the original social platforms.

Here, influencers often struggled to find deals through Instagram and TikTok, and so they have turned to Facebook groups as a solution. 

In fact, there are around 36,000 influencer marketing groups on Facebook that cater specifically to Vietnamese users.

When Indian influencers catch wind of these opportunities, it is often from influencers who are already part of these groups.

To give you a frame of reference, you can think of these groups as Vietnamese versions of the Indian influencer group 'The Content Club.' 

In these groups, users will often post about new opportunities they come across. 

So when an Indian influencer gets approached by a Vietnam-focused brand looking for help with marketing, they may tell that influencer to check out one of these groups to connect with more users.

Once those Indian influencers join the groups, they can access a treasure trove of opportunities. 

Vietnam-focused brands will often post about deals they need help with, as well as the details of their marketing campaigns, and the compensation offered for influencers to participate. 

After Indian influencers learn about these opportunities, they can pitch themselves to the brands.

In many cases, these brands are looking for help producing video content. 

So Indian creators with experience making videos that appeal to Indian audiences and can tailor their style to the Vietnamese market have a lucrative opportunity at their fingertips.

While these opportunities aren't reserved solely for Indian influencers, they have become increasingly attractive to them since they don't face the restrictions more established influencers in Vietnam do.

## ðŸŒŸWhy Are Indian Influencers Attractive to Vietnamese Brands?

Vietnamese brands often face a struggle when trying to connect with audiences in India. 

Often, they will send marketing staff to India to work with local influencers, but language barriers can inhibit their efforts. 

Additionally, once an influencer does get on board, the Vietnamese brand will often need to contract a production company in India to help create videos. 

Indian influencers provide a solution to all these problems. 

As they already produce a lot of content that resonates with Indian audiences, they can continue producing content in similar styles that are still fresh to the Indian viewer. 

Moreover, they speak the same language as the target audience, removing the language barrier altogether. 

Finally, many Indian influencers are able to produce their own videos, which removes the need for hiring a third party. 

This combination of being a closer match to the target audience, improved communication, and streamlined production makes Indian creators ideal partners for Vietnamese brands. 

## ðŸ“–What Are the Payment Methods for Indian Influencers Working with Vietnamese Brands?

As with influencer deals in India, Vietnamese brands primarily compensate influencers with money. 

Unlike India, where many influencers are still being paid with products or services only, influencers in Vietnam receive monetary compensation across the board. 

This provides an incentive for Indian influencers looking for paid brand deals. 

But when it comes to payment methods, we again see a divide between influencers in Vietnam and influencers in India. 

While Indian influencers primarily receive brand payments through bank transfers and payment platforms, Vietnamese brands commonly pay their influencers through mobile top-ups.

The reason that mobile top-ups are so popular among Vietnamese brands isn't arbitrary.

Due to the Walking Street incident in 2016, there has been rampant speculation that mobile app banking will never gain traction in Vietnam. 

The 2016 incident saw operations halted for dozens of financial organizations that were linked to mobile app banking services. 

As a result, cash and mobile top-ups remain among the most popular methods of payment within Vietnam.

That being said, we are seeing a clear push towards bank transfers when it comes to compensating influencers. 

Much of this push is resulting from the success that Indian influencers are having in Vietnam.

When Indian influencers pitch themselves to Vietnamese brands, they often mention that they primarily conduct transactions through platforms like PayPal and bank transfers. 

As a result, many Vietnamese brands are adapting their payment methods to accommodate them. 

Currently, many Vietnamese brands are using bank transfers directly, while others are using cryptocurrency to facilitate bridging the gap. 

## ðŸŽ¯Could Indian Influencers Impact the Future of Influencer Marketing in Vietnam?

Currently, Vietnam is experiencing the growing pains of influencer marketing as it evolves. 

While there are many groups focused on influencer marketing, it's still largely new to many users. 

As most users are unaware of the nuances of influencer marketing, they tend to overlook certain aspects that can thwart their efforts. 

For instance, many brands that post about their offers forget to mention the deadlines for applying. 

Similarly, many influencers fail to follow up with brands after pitching themselves for a campaign, leaving both sides hanging. 

Finally, influencers in Vietnam commonly deliver poorly made videos that fail to impress the brands that hire them. 

This is partially due to the fact that it's common for Vietnamese influencers to enlist their friends and family to help them produce videos. 

This can lead to a lack of cohesion in the final product, which can impede a final delivery that can meet or exceed the brands' expectations. 

However, we may see these issues resolved as Indian influencers become more prominent in the influencer marketing landscape of Vietnam.

Due to their experience navigating the nuances of influencer marketing in India, Indian influencers are particularly well suited to being mentors for Vietnamese influencers. 

By taking the role of educators as they develop their influence in Vietnam, Indian creators can share best practices and strategies that improve the overall quality of influencer marketing in the region. 

This would not only benefit influencers and brands in Vietnam but could also be the catalyst for influencer marketing becoming a much-prized asset in the Vietnamese marketing mix. 

## ðŸ“žConclusion

Often, people will say that a certain region or country is becoming more 'Westernized.' 

While this is true in many cases, it's still important to recognize that Western influences aren't automatic replacements. 

Instead, you can think of them as supplements. 

When a country or region incorporates aspects of Western cultures, it doesn't mean they're becoming a clone of them. 

Rather, they are adopting and adapting certain elements to fit their needs, wants, and desires. 

Influencer marketing in Vietnam is no different. 

As the Vietnamese influencer marketing ecosystem matures, we may see Indian creators leading the charge in developing it further.

They are positioning themselves to be at the forefront of this change. 

At the same time, they are also helping their Vietnamese counterparts rise as well. 

This is a prime example of how Indian influencers are not only earning more money for their talents, but they are also bridging gaps between communities and creating paths that benefit all users.

The future looks bright for Indian influencers who can adapt to the needs of Vietnamese brands.|
