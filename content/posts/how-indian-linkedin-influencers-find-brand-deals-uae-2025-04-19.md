While influencers on other social media platforms often flaunt their lavish lifestyles or eye-popping physiques to attract brand partnerships, their counterparts on LinkedIn take a decidedly different approach.

India has a sizable pool of the world‚Äôs most innovative and accomplished LinkedIn influencers, many of whom are experts at finding lucrative brand deals in the United Arab Emirates.

üíº The LinkedIn influencer strategy required when targeting UAE brands

LinkedIn has long been the go-to social media network for business-minded professionals. The platform operates as an informational tool as well as a networking hub for corporate executives, entrepreneurs, and other industry leaders.

As such, it offers a unique opportunity for influencers looking to ramp up their brand partnership activities, especially in the Middle East‚Äôs most interconnected economy.

As an Indian LinkedIn influencer targeting UAE brands, you‚Äôll want to ensure that your content is more polished and professional than what you may post on other platforms. This means providing a well-thought-out bio that outlines your relevant experience and area of expertise.

It‚Äôs recommended to display your most prestigious accolades and achievements within your profile photo banner. Also, ensure that your visual identity is consistent across all of your social media accounts and website.

UAE brands are quite discerning when it comes to influencer partnerships, and they‚Äôll want to see a cohesive brand presence before even thinking about getting involved with you.

üì£ What specific areas do UAE brands seek from Indian LinkedIn influencers?

Unlike influencers in the UAE who have a local audience presence, international brand partners typically seek Indian LinkedIn influencers who have a deeper understanding of business practices and social issues that matter to the UAE audience.

These issues may include the latest developments in corporate sustainability, efforts toward climate change, advancements in digital computing, or anything else of relevance to business professionals. 

üìà Which influencer types are in demand by UAE brands?

Indian LinkedIn influencers generally fall into one of three main categories that are aligned with the advertising needs of UAE brands:

**1. Corporate leaders**

UAE brands are often seeking to partner with corporate executives who can speak knowledgeably about management issues and other boardroom topics. This may include organizational change initiatives, financial forecasting, or even investor relations.

**2. Industry experts**

LinkedIn influencers may include subject matter experts who are well-informed about current trends in business, technology, or science. Indian professionals with distinguished expertise in these fields are often asked by UAE brands to join influencer partnerships.

**3. Motivational speakers**

Motivational speakers can use their LinkedIn presence to foster brand partnerships as well. UAE brands often seek out those professionals who have a track record of igniting passion and ambition, especially among youth audiences.

With the UAE‚Äôs recent push to encourage young Emiratis to enter the private workforce, Indian LinkedIn influencers who can inspire and motivate this demographic may find lucrative brand deals.

üï¥Ô∏è How should Indian LinkedIn influencers in India network with UAE brands?

Networking is a fine art on LinkedIn, and UAE brands typically expect a certain level of etiquette before entering into any conversation with an Indian influencer. 

First, it‚Äôs advisable to only engage with brands and other professionals who post content relevant to your expertise. This is one way to build rapport and help ensure that your name is top of mind when those brands are seeking influencer partners.

Second, avoid sending direct messages (DMs) to a LinkedIn connection‚Äîespecially a brand‚Äîunless they are already working with you in some capacity.

Otherwise, you risk coming off as obnoxious or opportunistic. Instead, engage with their content by liking and commenting where appropriate. This will help generate goodwill over time, and when they‚Äôre ready to consider influencer partnerships, they may think of you.

Finally, be sure to maintain a decent level of consistency in your content. In the face of abundant competition, UAE brands are less likely to partner with Indian influencers who are sporadic or inconsistent in their LinkedIn posting habits.

üìÖ Are there any brands from the UAE that are already working with Indian influencers on LinkedIn?

As more and more brands recognize the power of working with LinkedIn influencers, some notable UAE brands have partnered with talented Indian influencers on the platform.

These brands span a variety of industries, including luxury consumer goods, financial services, and even government agencies. 

As of 2025, three Indian LinkedIn influencers will already be known for their impactful work with UAE brands. 

**1. Robindro B. Kshetri**

Robindro B. Kshetri is a real estate executive, corporate trainer, and motivational speaker. He is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of RBS Realty, a luxury real estate agency in Mumbai.

Robindro is known for his engaging posts and videos that often provide morale-boosting encouragement for young professionals in the real estate industry. 

As a result, Armana Real Estate is already utilizing Robindro‚Äôs influence in this capacity. The Dubai-based brand is a leading property developer currently developing the magnificent Azzam Tower in Business Bay, Dubai. 

The tower is inspired by the iconic Burj Khalifa, and the Azzam Tower team is already utilizing Robindro to build excitement about its imminent completion.

**2. Aneesh Saraiya**

Aneesh Saraiya is a business consultant and author who has established himself as one of India‚Äôs top LinkedIn influencers. He specializes in corporate transformation and has conducted consulting projects and talks for brands all over the globe.

Aneesh has already reached out to UAE brands across various sectors including banking, technology, and government agencies. 

One of those agencies is the Dubai Police Department, which has begun working with Aneesh on several influencer initiatives. 

In a recent post update on LinkedIn, Aneesh indicated that his collaboration with the Dubai Police will focus on several exciting future projects that will promote public order and safety in Dubai.

**3. Mohit Arora**

Motivational speaker Mohit Arora focuses his influencer presence on helping professionals of all ages ‚Äúbreak the shackles of self-doubt.‚Äù He provides practical methods for embracing courage and taking action on one‚Äôs aspirations.

This expertise has already landed Mohit a partnership with UAE brand Max Group, which is a global leader in manufacturing high-quality industrial equipment.

As of late 2023, Mohit is already scheduled to attend a company event in Dubai where he will speak to its team members about building confidence and other helpful life skills.

üó£ How can Indian LinkedIn influencers evaluate brand deal opportunities with UAE brands?

When evaluating brand deals with UAE brands, Indian LinkedIn influencers should always consider whether the brand agreement makes sense for their personal brand.

Since many Indian LinkedIn influencers have built a strong reputation on the platform, it‚Äôs vital to ensure that this reputation isn‚Äôt put at risk by working with the wrong brands.

If you‚Äôre unsure whether a specific brand is right for you, consider the following questions you could ask yourself.

1. **Why is the brand interested in me?**

You should always try to understand what drew the UAE brand to you. Did they like your motivational message, insights, or your experience?

2. **How will I integrate the brand into my content?**

Think carefully and prepare how you will include the brand in your LinkedIn posts and other communications. 

3. **What are the brand‚Äôs expectations?**

Determine what the brand expects from you and what you expect in return.

4. **How will I disclose the partnership?**

It‚Äôs important to disclose to your audience when a post is sponsored by a brand. You‚Äôll want to consider what disclosure method you‚Äôll use.

5. **How does the brand align with my ethics and values?**

Asking yourself this question is key to determining whether a brand deal opportunity is a good fit. 

If the UAE brand is offering something unethical, such as a bribe or illicit financial arrangement, then you‚Äôll know the partnership is not a good one.

6. **What is the compensation for the brand deal?**

You‚Äôll also want to consider how you‚Äôll be compensated for working with the brand. This could include anything from monetary payments to free products, or a combination of both.

ü™ô How are brand deals typically compensated for Indian LinkedIn influencers working with UAE brands?

Indian LinkedIn influencers should be aware that brands historically compensate influencers in one of two ways.

The first is monetary compensation, where the brand pays the influencer a flat fee for creating content on their behalf. 

The second arrangement is through performance-based compensation, where the influencer receives a fee based on how well the content performs. 

Performance metrics may include anything from the number of post likes to the number of new customer accounts created for the brand via a posted link.

Interestingly, brands working with Indian LinkedIn influencers in the UAE commonly utilize a hybrid of both compensation methods. 

Because performance metrics can vary widely between social media platforms, UAE brands are strategic in how they choose to compensate influencers.

For example, if the influencer is merely posting a message on their LinkedIn page, the brand may opt for a smaller flat fee. 

However, if performance metrics are easy to quantify (such as capturing new customer accounts), brands may offer a higher fee for those influencers who capture a high volume of conversions.

üìç Are there any specific legalities for Indian LinkedIn influencers to understand about working with UAE brands?

Before partnering with any UAE brand, Indian LinkedIn influencers should familiarize themselves with some of the more common legal requirements.

For instance, under UAE law, influencers are required to disclose if they‚Äôve been compensated by a brand for a post. 

In fact, influencers who don‚Äôt disclose compensation run the risk of facing hefty fines, which can reach up to $136,000 USD.

Also, influencers may not mislead their audiences about their association with a specific brand, nor may they claim to be a representative of the brand. 

Finally, it‚Äôs advised that Indian influencers use contracts to formalize brand partnerships with UAE brands. Doing so helps minimize the risk of misunderstandings about the terms and conditions of the influencer agreement.

‚ú® Conclusion

Indian LinkedIn influencers are already proving that their social media platform of choice is an excellent avenue for finding lucrative brand deals in the UAE.

By projecting a professional presence, carefully engaging in networking activities, and staying aware of brand partnership requirements, Indian LinkedIn influencers are quickly establishing themselves as some of the best in the world.

As the industry evolves, they‚Äôll have to keep learning and adapting in order to stay ahead of the competition.
