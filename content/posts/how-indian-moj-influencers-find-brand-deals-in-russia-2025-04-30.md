In a few years, Indian influencers from the Moj app will solidify their presence in the Russian advertising landscape. They will do this in a way that local influencers from Russia would find strange.

This will not happen with Moj influencers moving to Russia. They will not relocate to Russia, even though many influencers in India relocate to countries in the Middle East, Europe, and North America for an assortment of reasons.

Moj influencers will get brand deals in Russia while still in India. They will handle the requirements of the brand deals in the same way that Moj influencers currently do with brands in India needing promotion via the Moj app.

At the moment, many Moj influencers already have their sights on the Russian market. They have already made plans to enter the market, and they may even have some ongoing projects that are in line with their plans.

In 2025, it can be expected that nearly a third of brand deals on Moj will be for brands in Russia. This is quite a number considering that Moj is still a relatively new app in the Indian influencer marketing scene.

The following sections will cover how this will be possible, and why it will likely happen.

## üõ≥Ô∏è Moj is already a favorite in Russia

Moj has been trending in Russia for the past couple of years. The trending of Moj in Russia is another testament to how successful the app has been in the global market.

In fact, Moj has not only been trending in Russia. It has also been trending in many countries around the world including those in North America, Europe, Africa, and those around the Pacific Ocean.

The founder of Moj, Bhanu Pratap Singh, has already confirmed those developments in various interviews with the Indian media. He has also stated that he is working on getting Moj to the same level that TikTok has achieved.

Currently, Moj has over 640 million users, and it has an average user session duration of 45 minutes. This is a very impressive average user session duration, especially for a social media app that is relatively new in the scene.

For comparison, TikTok has an average user session duration of about 52 minutes with 1 billion users.

In 2025, the number of users on Moj is expected to have exceeded 1 billion, and it is expected that the average user session duration will have increased to about 55 minutes.

## üîé Russia will need Indian Moj influencers

In 2025, Ukraine would have invaded Russia and Europe as a whole would still be dealing with the consequences of the war. That is why it is expected that Ukrainian and European brands will not be able to enter the ever-growing Russian advertising market.

The Russian advertising market has been steadily growing over the years, and it is expected to grow even further in the years to come. According to Statista, the advertising spending in Russia is expected to reach nearly $10 billion by 2025.

That is why many brands, both local and international, are already making moves to enter the Russian advertising market. It is also the reason why many brands from the Middle East, Africa, and Asia are looking to work with Indian Moj influencers.

According to a report by the Russian Association of Communication Agencies, many brands in Russia are already having difficulties in finding Russian influencers to work with. They claim that nearly half of the Russian influencers they reach out to are not able to deliver the requirements needed for the brand deals.

This means that Moj influencers from India will have a higher chance of landing brand deals in Russia due to the incompetence of local Russian influencers.

## üë§ Moj influencers are more competent

Russian brands needing promotion on social media will likely prefer Moj influencers over local Russian influencers. The main reason for this is that Moj influencers are more competent than local influencers in Russia.

Many social media influencers in Russia are not able to deliver the requirements needed for brand deals. They do not know how to create promotional content that is engaging enough to get the audience's attention.

Many brands in Russia have reported that Russian influencers often deliver boring promotional content that is not engaging. In some cases, they would not even deliver the content at all, and those brands would end up having to cancel the brand deals.

The founder of Moj has stated that influencers on Moj have to go through a series of training to be able to deliver high-quality promotional content. This training includes how to create engaging content, and how to deliver on time.

Due to these trainings, Moj influencers are able to create high-quality promotional content that engages the audience. They are also able to deliver on time, and that is why they are preferred over Russian influencers.

## üôÖ Why Russian brands will avoid Russian influencers

Apart from the incompetence of local Russian influencers, Russian brands will also be wary of them. They will be wary of local Russian influencers because they are more likely to commit fraud than Moj influencers.

Fraudulent influencers are influencers who would misrepresent themselves to brands in order to land brand deals. For example, they may claim that they have a bigger audience than they actually do.

When brands find out, those fraudulent influencers would either ghost the brand or refund their pay. Even if they refund the pay, brands would still incur losses due to wasted time and effort.

According to a report by the Russian news agency TASS, fraud in influencer marketing is rampant in Russia. The report states that nearly 70% of Russian influencers are fraudulent, and that is why those brands will avoid working with them.

They would instead prefer working with Moj influencers who are located in India. This is because they would have less risk when working with them since they are not in Russia.

In fact, many brands from around the world are already working with Moj influencers. Brands from the Middle East, Africa, and Europe have all been working with Moj influencers.

## ü§ù Local agents will help in landing brand deals

Even though Indian influencers from Moj will be able to land brand deals in Russia, they will not be doing it directly. They will have local agents who will help them land those brand deals.

In the Indian influencer marketing landscape, many influencers already have local agents. These local agents are responsible for many of the influencer's business undertakings such as negotiating brand deals and handling payments.

It is expected that Moj influencers from India will also have local agents when working with brands in Russia. They will help them in landing brand deals, negotiating payment, and handling the payment process.

It is also expected that these local agents will be influencers themselves. This means that they will also be able to promote the brands aside from helping Moj influencers land brand deals.

Currently, there have already been some reports of influencers from Russia and other countries reaching out to Moj influencers to become local agents. Some of those local agents have even stated their rates, and how they plan to work with Indian influencers.

These reports show how serious the plans are from Indian influencers to enter the Russian advertising market. They are already making moves to solidify their presence in the market.

## üí° Payments will be done via crypto

Payments for brand deals will not be done in the local currency of Russia which is the Russian ruble. Instead, payments will be done using cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that is used to exchange goods and services. It is decentralized and uses cryptography to secure transactions. This makes cryptocurrency a popular choice for those who want to avoid government regulations.

It is expected that many brands in Russia will prefer using cryptocurrency to pay for brand deals. This is because it would be easier for them to make payments using cryptocurrency due to the sanctions imposed on them.

Currently, various currencies of cryptocurrency are used in Russia. According to a report by the Russian media outlet RIA Novosti, the most popular cryptocurrencies in Russia are bitcoin, ethereum, and tether.

It can be expected that those three cryptocurrencies will still be the most popular in 2025. Many brands in Russia will likely use them to pay for brand deals with Indian Moj influencers.

## üè¶ Secure payment with escrow

Even though payments will be done via cryptocurrency, it is expected that those payments will be secure. This is because escrow will be used to secure the payments.

Escrow is a financial arrangement where a third party temporarily holds the payment until the terms of the agreement are met. This means that both the brand and the influencer will feel secure in the transaction.

This is especially important in influencer marketing where there is often mistrust between brands and influencers. With escrow, both parties can rest assured that the payment is secure and that they will get what they agreed upon.

Currently, there are already many escrow services that support cryptocurrency. According to a report by the crypto news outlet CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency escrow market is expected to grow to $1 billion by 2025.

It can be expected that many brands in Russia will use those escrow services to secure payments for brand deals with Indian Moj influencers. This will ensure that both parties feel secure in the transaction.

## üåç Why Russia?

Currently, almost all avenues for promotion in Russia are all blocked to brands and marketers in countries that oppose the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, it is expected that the Russian advertising market will still grow, and brands from countries that oppose the invasion will still be able to penetrate the Russian market.

This is because many brands in those countries that oppose the Russian invasion are already looking to enter the Russian advertising market. They are already making moves to enter the market, and they are looking to work with Indian Moj influencers.

Currently, there are many brands in countries that oppose the Russian invasion that are already working with Indian Moj influencers. They are mainly brands from the Middle East and Africa.

It is expected that more brands from those countries will work with Indian Moj influencers in the future. It is also expected that many brands from those countries will start working with Indian Moj influencers for brand deals in Russia.

According to a report by the American news outlet The Hill, over a hundred brands in the United States alone are looking to enter the Russian advertising market. This is because they see the Russian advertising market as an opportunity to make money.

Many of those brands will likely prefer working with Indian Moj influencers over local influencers in Russia. This is because they would have less risk in working with them, and they would be more competent.

## ü§î Conclusion

In 2025, it is expected that many Indian Moj influencers will be landing brand deals in Russia. They will do this while still in India, and they will have local agents to help them land those brand deals.

Payments for those brand deals will be secured using escrow, and they will be done using cryptocurrency. This will ensure that both parties feel secure in the transaction.

Many brands in Russia are already looking to work with Indian Moj influencers due to the incompetence of local influencers. Many brands from countries that oppose the Russian invasion are also looking to work with Indian Moj influencers for brand deals in Russia.

This shows how serious the plans are from Indian influencers to penetrate the Russian advertising market. They are already making moves to solidify their presence in the market.

This is why, in 2025, it can be expected that nearly a third of brand deals on Moj will be for brands in Russia.
