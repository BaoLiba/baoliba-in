When we think of influencer marketing, we often think of Instagram. Influencer marketing is nothing new, but the platform's wide reach and diverse audience can leave marketers wondering how to tap into it. 

Can Instagram help you achieve your marketing goals? The answer is a resounding yes!

According to a recent survey, 37% of Indian marketers believe Instagram is the best platform for influencer marketing, making it the most popular platform for Indian marketers as well.

## Why Instagram is an Important Platform for Influencer Marketing in India

India boasts one of the largest populations in the world, the majority of which are active social media users. 

The Global Digital 2023 report determined that of the 1.428 billion people residing in India, 639 million of them are social media users. That's almost half the country!

That same report indicated that 82.3% of Indian social media users are active on Instagram, ranking it as the second most popular platform in the country. 

With a population that large, it's no wonder that marketers are turning to Instagram to reach their audience.

Additionally, 67% of millennial and Gen Z Indian internet users claim to have purchased a product or service as a result of seeing it on Instagram, according to the same report. 

So not only do users flock to Instagram, but they also buy when they're there! 

## Why Indian Brands Collaborate with Instagram Influencers

In a country as diverse as India, being able to target a specific segment of the population is crucial for brands. 

Instagram influencers cater to niche audiences with unique interests, lifestyles, and demographics, attracting their followers with high-quality images, engaging captions, and authentic storytelling.

As a result, their followers regard them as experts in their field, whether that be fashion, travel, technology, or food. 

This level of respect means that when an influencer recommends a product or service, it has a greater chance of being seen as trustworthy and credible than traditional advertising.

## Unique Influencer Marketing Strategies for the Indian Audience

Just like any other market, Indian consumers respond to influencer marketing differently than others. 

To win over the Indian audience, marketers must adapt their strategies accordingly.

The following strategies will help marketers connect with their Indian audience more effectively:

### Embrace Regional Diversity

When marketing to a country as diverse as India, it is important to tailor campaigns to the local cultural context. 

With over 1.4 billion people spread across 28 states and 8 union territories, India boasts a rich range of cultures, religions, and languages. 

Marketers must tap into this diversity by creating campaigns that resonate with different regions and communities within the country. 

One way to do this is by collaborating with influencers and creators from a variety of backgrounds. 

Not only does this position your brand as inclusive, but it also allows you to incorporate local perspectives and themes into your marketing campaign. 

For example, to promote its 2023 sedan, Ford partnered with regional content creators in a campaign that included influencer marketing, paid media, and outdoor advertising to reach specific consumer segments in cities across the country.

### Leverage Social Causes

Indian consumers are becoming more conscious of social issues, and they tend to gravitate towards brands that share their values. 

Marketers can connect with this audience by collaborating with influencers that are committed to social causes relevant to Indian consumers. 

While this can take many forms, the most common include sustainability and women’s empowerment. 

For example, in a campaign focused on sustainability, the social media marketing and production agency Social Awaken partnered with a variety of influencers to promote Olena's eco-friendly, all-natural products. 

Influencers demonstrated how to use the products and touted their benefits while seamlessly incorporating social responsibility messaging.

### Create Localized Content

In a country where “local” can mean many different things, marketers must take regional preferences into consideration. 

For example, while Bollywood is a popular cultural reference throughout the country, so is Tamil cinema for Tamil Nadu and Telugu cinema for Andhra Pradesh. 

This means that regional film stars may be equally as influential as Bollywood stars in their respective regions, so marketers should leverage this and collaborate with the appropriate influencers. 

Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana, the Maharashtra government's health insurance scheme, enlisted the help of TV star and Marathi film actress Jaya Bhattacharya. 

This collaboration helped the scheme reach its primary audience of rural women, ensuring they received the benefits they deserved.

### Monitor Internet Usage Trends

Social media usage varies across regions, demographics, and even industries. 

Marketers must keep tabs on changing social media trends in order to avoid wasting time and resources on channels that are no longer effective or relevant. 

For example, while Instagram is the most popular platform for influencer marketing overall, it is not as popular for B2B marketing, particularly amongst the tech sector. 

In fact, according to a report by influencer marketing agency Tribe, LinkedIn is the #1 platform for B2B influencer marketing in India, followed closely by Twitter. 

Additionally, the report stated that 61% of tech professionals on Twitter are open to engaging with influencer recommendations and content. 

So if your business is B2B and in tech, you may find more success engaging with influencers on LinkedIn and Twitter than Instagram.

### Avoiding Controversy

While marketers can and should take social issues into account, they must be aware of the potential backlash. 

India is a country rich in culture, and that can come with a healthy dose of differing opinions as well. 

While 29% of Indian marketers believe LGBT+ content will see the most growth in the coming years, they must use caution in their messaging. 

According to a survey by Wavemaker, 66% of Indian consumers believe that LGBT+ content is inappropriate in advertising. 

As such, brands should steer clear of LGBT+ messaging for now and focus on other social causes that resonate more favorably with Indian audiences.

## Conclusion

Instagram is a powerful platform for influencer marketing in India. 

By embracing the country's diversity, collaborating with social advocates, creating localized content, and monitoring trends, marketers can connect with Indian consumers more effectively and overcome the challenges that come with such a vast market.

As with any other marketing strategy, consistency is key. 

By establishing a strong brand presence on Instagram through influencer marketing, marketers can reach their Indian audience and achieve their marketing goals effectively.
