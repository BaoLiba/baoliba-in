In the world of influencer marketing, getting sponsorships from brands has always been the hardest nut to crack. Brands that need to sell their products rely on influencers with massive followings to do the heavy lifting for them, and influencers, in turn, need those lucrative sponsorships to earn a livelihood.

But to become a fully-fledged influencer, especially in the niche Telegram market, is no bed of roses. For Indian influencers, Telegram is an attractive yet challenging platform that requires a different approach compared to its mainstream counterparts like Instagram and TikTok. 

In a recent trend, many Indian influencers who primarily use Telegram for their niche content have found that they can easily earn money by working with companies based out of Brazil. 

In fact, Telegram influencers from India are becoming so successful in this brand endorsement model that they are now regarded as the go-to solution for Brazilian companies looking to boost their visibility in the Indian market. 

## üí° Influencers in Brazil Prefer Niche Telegram Marketing


Telegram has been around for almost a decade now and has gained acclaim as a secure alternative to other mainstream social media channels. 

Not only does it provide robust privacy features that are far superior to its competitors, but Telegram is also more conducive to niche content. Influencers who specialize in specific niches can organize their followings into dedicated channels for information dissemination. 

Even the mainstream influencers who have previously built their careers on Instagram or TikTok are now joining Telegram to promote their content. 

As a result, Telegram has become the new darling of the influencer marketing world, especially for niche content that doesn't comply with the guidelines of mainstream platforms.

And that's precisely why influencers in Brazil prefer to work with Indian influencers on Telegram compared to their counterparts in Brazil. 

According to Noeli Ferreira, CMO of Noeli Adverts, "There are a variety of reasons why Indian Telegram influencers are more attractive for brand deals compared to Brazilian influencers. The most obvious reason is the cost. Hiring an Indian influencer on Telegram is 20% less expensive, on average, than hiring a Brazilian influencer."

## üöÄ How Indian Telegram Influencers Attract Brand Deals from Brazil


Unlike mainstream social media platforms that are saturated with influencers vying for attention, Telegram's search features make it easier for brands to discover influencers who align with their goals. 

When companies in Brazil search for influencers on Telegram, they are presented with a list of channels that fall within their specified criteria. And since many of these channels are run by Indian Telegram influencers, it's common for Brazilian companies to reach out to them for paid promotions. 

According to Indian Telegram influencer, Rohan Soni, "Most of the brand endorsements I do on Telegram are from companies in Brazil. This is frankly because they are the first to reach out. I don't focus on Brazil or anything. I just seem to rank higher on Telegram's search features, and that's why they gravitate towards me for endorsements."

In fact, many Brazilian companies that are seeking endorsements from Indian influencers have resorted to using Indian-based influencer marketing platforms to find them, further solidifying their reputation in this niche market. 

### üìä Indian Telegram Influencers Rank Higher on Search Results

Telegram's search features primarily rely on keywords, much like Google. 

While Brazilian influencers may use keywords that are common in Brazil, Indian influencers have been optimizing their channel names, descriptions, and post texts with keywords that are popular in both India and Brazil. 

For instance, while most Brazilian influencers would use keywords like "Brasil" and "Brazileiro," Indian influencers are more likely to use "Brazil" and "Brazilian." This strategic difference in keyword usage provides Indian influencers with an edge when it comes to ranking higher in Telegram's search results. 

According to Brazilian influencer marketing consultant, Eduardo Almeida, "Indian influencers are way ahead of Brazilian influencers when it comes to optimizing their channels for search visibility on Telegram."

## ‚ùó Indian Telegram Influencers Are Being Robbed


While the rise of Indian Telegram influencers in Brazil may seem like a win-win situation, it has not come without its challenges. 

Due to the convenience of working remotely, many Indian Telegram influencers who take up endorsements from Brazilian companies are frequently robbed of their earnings. 

A common method of robbery employed by criminals is called the "advance payment scam." Under this scam, fraudsters posing as brand representatives typically reach out to Indian influencers on Telegram and claim to be interested in hiring them for a paid promotion. 

After negotiating the details of the promotion, the fraudsters will then send the influencer a payment that is much larger than the agreed amount. Realizing that they have sent too much money, the fraudsters will then ask the Indian influencer to send the excess funds back. 

In the end, the Indian influencer is left sending their own money back to the fraudster while being robbed of their precious time and effort. 

According to Bhavya Sharma, an Indian Telegram influencer with a strong following in Brazil, "It's frustrating, honestly. I have to deal with so many robbers who claim to be Brazilian companies. They waste so much of my time and energy. The worst part is that some robbers get lucky and successfully rob me."

## üí∏ How to Avoid Being Scammed in Brazil

Unfortunately, because Telegram is an unregulated platform, it is very difficult for Indian influencers to recover their money after being robbed in advance payment scams. 

While they could potentially report these criminals to the authorities, it would be impossible for the local law enforcement in India to coordinate with Brazilian law enforcement. 

To avoid being scammed, Indian influencers are advised to use escrow services for all their Brazilian brand endorsements. 

Escrow services act as neutral third-party intermediaries that take custody of money, assets, or properties exchanged between two parties. In this case, the escrow service would take custody of the payment sent by the Brazilian company and only release it to the Indian influencer once the agreed promotion is completed and verified. 

Some popular escrow services for Telegram influencers include 2Checkout and GcEscrow. 

## üì¢ How to Spot Fake Brazilian Companies

Another common method employed by robbers to defraud Indian Telegram influencers is to fake their identities. 

Some robbers may pose as representatives of legitimate Brazilian companies, while others may simply create their own fake companies out of thin air. 

One way to verify if a Brazilian company is legitimate is to check its website. If a Brazilian company approaching you for an endorsement does not have a website, it is highly probable that it is a scam. 

Another way to spot scams is if the requesting company has poor spelling and grammar. 

Despite being a common language, English is not the first language for most Brazilians. If a Brazilian company asking for an endorsement has poor spelling and grammar, it is most likely a scam. 

## üéüÔ∏è Conclusion 


Despite the challenges that Indian Telegram influencers face getting sponsorships from Brazilian companies, the rise of this unique influencer marketing trend is a welcome development. 

As more and more influencers transition from mainstream platforms to niche platforms like Telegram, the global influencer marketing landscape will continue to evolve. 

With the right strategies and tools in place, Indian Telegram influencers can remain competitive and profitable in this new era of influencer marketing.
