Indian influencers have long since taken their business to the global scene, and for Snapchat influencers from India, France is their favourite destination. 

Their rise in France is owed to the french-speaking community that exists on the platform, as many users from diverse backgrounds have joined the app in droves in the last few years.

With one of the highest potential of engagement rates, Snapchat is the holy grail for influencers when it comes to engagement rates and brand deals. The french market is no exception to this rule.

The recent rise of Bollywood-themed media in France has also increased the demand for Indian Snapchat influencers, as potential clients and brands look to capitalize on this trend. 


## üìà The Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie

As of 2023, France has 24 million Snapchat users, making it one of the top markets for the platform. 

The platform counts over 75% of 18-34 year-olds as active users, and the numbers are set to increase as the app‚Äôs growth continues to rise year on year. 

Snapchat has shown impressive growth in Europe over the last couple of years, and statistics show that France has remained true to Snapchat‚Äôs expansion strategy, as 23% of all users who joined in Europe were french. 

With France being the largest country in Europe, Snapchat is now at the top of the mountain when it comes to apps in France. 

The average time spent daily on the app is 30 minutes, with over 20 million snaps sent on the platform daily. 


## üì∏ Why Snapchat?

Snapchat is unique in the way it operates, and this is what sets it apart from its competitors. 

Unlike Instagram, Snapchat is ephemeral, meaning posts last only 24 hours before they disappear completely.

This gives it a unique edge over other platforms, as users cannot scroll back and look at past posts. This creates a sense of urgency for users to engage with posts immediately, as they cannot look back on them later, leading to what some describe as the highest engagement rates between users, as people engage with posts that interest them as they come.

With the average engagement rate being 131% higher than Instagram and 306% higher than Facebook, Snapchat is the go-to app for influencers, and brands are keen to partner with influencers on the platform. 

Some of France‚Äôs top brands have long recognized this, including others from around the world. 


## üá´üá∑ The French Market

French brands are looking to capitalize on the growing number of Indians in France, and Indian Snapchat influencers are more than ready to help them accomplish that.

Both sides of this partnership get a win-win scenario, as influencers get paid in euros, an upgrade from the rupees they are used to, and brands get access to a new market of potential customers.  

According to a report by TV5Monde, there are more than 800,000 Indians living in France, the largest Indian diaspora in Europe.

Many come to France to study, particularly in the fields of engineering and business. 

The number of Indian students in France has tripled since 2020, and Indian students are now the largest foreign student group in France. 

Statistics show that more than half of the Indians in France are under the age of thirty, and they have overtaken the Chinese as the largest group of foreign students in France. 

This has seen French brands re-evaluate their marketing strategies to appeal more to this demographic.

One of the best ways of doing so is hiring an influencer that resonates with the demographic of potential customers. 


## üíº How Do They Find Deals?

Snapchat influencers in India find brand deals with French brands by using a similar strategy to the rest of the globe.

The first step is to join Snapchat groups and communities that are French based. This is easy to do, as many are dedicated to different interests, including Snapchat for business, Snapchat influencers, and more. 

They then begin to build their profile according to the french market. This includes using the French language and creating content that resonates with potential customers in France.

They also engage with content from French Snapchatters. This helps them to gain exposure within the community, and others are likely to check out their profile after seeing them engage with content they like. 

Once they have built a sizeable community for themselves, they start reaching out directly to French brands to inquire if they are interested in marketing through them. 


## üß≠ Payment Methods

When it comes to payment, Snapchat influencers from India don‚Äôt have to worry about anything, as they have various options at their disposal. 

These include PayPal, TransferWise, and direct bank transfers. 

Many brands prefer to use PayPal, as it is fast, secure, and inexpensive. It also allows brands to keep track of their expenses, as they can pull all invoices sent and received.  

PayPal allows users in India to receive payments in euros. The money can then be converted into rupees and withdrawn from their local bank accounts. 

When it comes to fees, PayPal is one of the most affordable payment options available, charging 2.5% of the amount sent plus a small fixed fee according to the currency. 

For example, sending 1,000 euros will cost a total of 27.16 euros when using PayPal. 


## üí∞ How Much Do They Earn?

The amount of money influencers earn in France varies considerably, depending on their profile and the brand that is working with them. 

Many influencers report making from 100 to 500 euros for a single post, with the average being around 250 euros.

Although it varies, this is an upgrade from what many Indian Snapchat influencers are used to earning when working with Indian brands.

## ‚ùó Pitfalls to Avoid

While opportunities in the French market are vast, Indian influencers must also be aware of potential scams and pitfalls.

The first step in ensuring that they are working with legitimate brands is to only work with companies that have a proper website. Brands that only have social media pages are often scams, as they have no way of being held responsible for a deal gone wrong. 

They should also get a proper contract before starting any work. Contracts are legally binding and will ensure that influencers get paid accordingly. Contracts should include payment details, what work is required, and a timeline for completion. 

They should also be aware of the potential hidden fees when using payment services like PayPal. While most payments will come through unscathed, some may incur fees that are unexpected. 


## üîë Conclusion

The popularity of Indian Snapchat influencers in France is a testament to the global landscape of influencer marketing. 

It proves that brands are looking beyond their borders when it comes to influencer marketing, particularly in diverse markets like France.

With many French brands seeking to tap into the growing Indian demographic living in France, and with Snapchat influencers from India ready to assist them with that, the future is bright for both parties. 

As the Indian diaspora in France continues to grow, so too will the opportunities for Indian Snapchat influencers there.
