Navigating the international influencer landscape can be a daunting task, especially when the influencer is from India and the brand is from Bangladesh.

Nonetheless, we‚Äôve been noticing that a growing number of Indian Moj influencers are getting paid deals to advertise Bangladeshi brands. 

You read that correctly.

Indian Moj influencers are securing brand deals in Bangladesh.

It‚Äôs a curious phenomenon that begs the question: why are Indian influencers looking across the border for brand deals?

To help us get to the bottom of this question, we reached out to several Indian Moj influencers who are currently working with Bangladeshi brands. 

In this article, we will share their insights, discuss why this trend is happening, and explore how Indian influencers can secure brand deals with Bangladeshi brands. 

## üáßüá© Bangladesh on Moj

Although Moj is an Indian app, Bangladeshi users have embraced the platform. 

Currently, India is the only country that allows Moj to monetize content for creators through brand deals. 

Thus, Bangladeshi brands looking to advertise on Moj have to pay Indian influencers to promote their products. 

## ü§ù Bangladeshi Brands on Moj

The rise of Bangladeshi brands using Indian Moj influencers to promote their products has been increasing over the past few years. 

Not only is it a cost-effective way to advertise, but it also targets the Indian audience, a key demographic for any growing Bangladeshi company.

According to several Indian Moj influencers, Bangladeshi brands will reach out to them through Instagram DMs to pitch a brand deal. 

Normally, this will involve the Bangladeshi brand sending a sample product to the influencer‚Äôs address in India along with a promise to pay a certain amount for the promotion once it is completed. 

Most of the time, the payment will be through a digital payment platform such as PayPal or Payoneer, which allow for international transactions. 

Once payment is made, the Indian influencer will post the promotion on Moj and send the link to the Bangladeshi brand. 

## üí∏ How Bangladeshi Brands Pay Indian Influencers

In a recent article, we detailed how Indian influencers are getting paid through GPay, a digital payment app restricted to India. 

Although GPay is not available in Bangladesh, the same principles still apply; Bangladeshi brands have simply found alternate payment methods that can send money to India. 

In addition to PayPal and Payoneer, Bangladeshi brands are using digital payment apps that allow for international transactions. 

For instance, several Indian Moj influencers we spoke to reported that Bangladeshi brands have used Skrill, a digital wallet that can send and receive funds globally. 

Additionally, some Bangladeshi brands will pay Indian influencers in cryptocurrency, which can be sent anywhere in the world. 

While it is unclear how many Bangladeshi brands are using Indian influencers for promotions, we do know that more Indian influencers are expressing interest in securing brand deals with Bangladeshi brands. 

As far as our sources can tell, it is a growing trend that has yet to peak.

## üîç Why Indian Influencers Are Seeking Brand Deals in Bangladesh

According to the influencers we spoke to, they are not intentionally seeking out Bangladeshi brands to work with. 

Rather, these Bangladeshi brands are approaching Indian influencers instead of local influencers‚Äîwhether they are from Bangladesh or India. 

To share their insights about why this is happening, we reached out to two Indian Moj influencers who have successfully promoted Bangladeshi brands.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Bangladeshis Like Indians

Ravi Kumar is a rising influencer on Moj who recently secured a brand deal with a Bangladeshi clothing brand. 

Kumar is a 24-year-old from Delhi who primarily posts skit-style videos, often with a comedic twist. 

He has amassed over 200,000 followers on Moj since he started about a year ago. 

Kumar explained that it is not uncommon for Bangladeshi brands to reach out to Indian influencers as Western brands do the same thing. 

He stated that ‚ÄúBangladeshis are more fond of Indians than Pakistanis. Since they are a former colony of Britain, they share more cultural similarities with Indians.‚Äù

Kumar continued, ‚ÄúThis is why they prefer to work with Indian influencers over local influencers. Plus, there is a size difference when it comes to Indian and Bangladeshi influencers.‚Äù

### üìä More Bangladeshi Viewers on Moj

According to the Indian influencers we spoke to, Bangladeshi brands prefer Indian influencers for a number of reasons. 

First, Indian influencers simply have a larger audience than Bangladeshi influencers on Moj. 

In fact, India is the only country where Moj has monetized content for creators. 

Thus, it is much more worth a Bangladeshi brand‚Äôs time to work with an Indian influencer instead of a local one.

According to Kumar, ‚ÄúThe Moj app has more users in Bangladesh than it does in India. That‚Äôs why Bangladeshi brands prefer to work with Indian influencers; they can target their ads to their own audience.‚Äù

## ‚ùó Challenges for Indian Influencers Promoting Bangladeshi Brands

While the idea of promoting Bangladeshi brands may sound appealing, there are some challenges that Indian influencers must be aware of. 

For starters, there are legal implications that an Indian influencer must navigate. 

Kumar explained, ‚ÄúIf you are an Indian influencer promoting a Bangladeshi brand, you are technically advertising a foreign brand in India without permission. This could lead to legal issues down the line, especially if the Bangladeshi brand is producing counterfeit products.‚Äù

### üö® Counterfeit Products

Kumar‚Äôs point about counterfeit products is particularly troubling. 

According to the influencers we spoke to, counterfeit products are common in Bangladeshi brand deals. 

For instance, Kumar told us that the clothing brand that reached out to him sells counterfeit Nike clothing. 

Not only that, but the brand sent Kumar only one piece of clothing instead of a full set, which is what they originally promised. 

He stated, ‚ÄúI learned that this Bangladeshi brand sells counterfeit Nike merchandise. But I am still going to promote their products since I need the money. I‚Äôll make sure to clarify to my audience that this clothing is not authentic Nike merchandise.‚Äù

## üí° Conclusion

While it is still unclear how many Indian influencers are promoting Bangladeshi brands, it seems that it is a growing trend. 

As the Moj app continues to gain a foothold in Bangladesh, we expect that Bangladeshi brands will continue to seek out Indian influencers.

If you are an Indian influencer looking to promote Bangladeshi brands, be aware of the challenges. 

While promoting Bangladeshi brands may be lucrative, it could also have legal ramifications down the line.
