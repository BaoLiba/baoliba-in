## üéÆ Japanese Twitch influencers only

Brands that want to market goods designed for gamers through Twitch influencer marketing must work strictly with Japanese Twitch streamers.

In 2025, Indian brands can only expect to collaborate with Japanese Twitch streamers, as the Japanese market is almost completely dominated by Twitch, according to a 2023 report by Statista.

YouTube, which is the largest gaming live streaming platform globally, only ranks third in Japan, where Niconico took second place.

Furthermore, since Twitch only features Japanese content for live streamers, Japan is considered the birthplace of Twitch streaming.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Twitch influencers offer various marketing services

Japanese Twitch influencers can provide brands a variety of marketing services that can help them achieve their business goals.

Brands can collaborate with Japanese Twitch influencers to obtain the following marketing services:


- üéÆ **Game live streams**

Japanese Twitch influencers can stream various genres of games on their channels, including adventure, fighting, role-playing, and shooter games. 

Brands can promote their goods by supplying the popular equipment, and they will likely see good sales figures.

Brands can also pay Japanese Twitch influencers to stream their game titles. 

The influencer must first receive the consent of their audience and promote to them the impending stream of the brand‚Äôs game title, called a pre-promotion. 

They can then go live with the game and showcase its product features and benefits.


- üì¶ **Unboxings**

Japanese Twitch influencers can create unboxing content during their live streams. 

They can show their audience the packaging and contents of the brand‚Äôs products, praising their product quality and appearance.


- üïπÔ∏è **Playthroughs**

Twitch influencers can also showcase the products in playthrough segments of their live streams. 

Brands can pay Japanese Twitch influencers to demonstrate their products in action while providing helpful commentary.


- üó£Ô∏è **Product endorsements**

Japanese Twitch influencers can share their opinions of various merchandise from brands. 

These product endorsements can assure potential buyers of their quality and usefulness, resulting in higher conversion rates.


- üé§ **Interviews**

Brands can collaborate with Japanese Twitch influencers by having them interview their people, such as their CEO or brand ambassador. 

This marketing tactic can help brands humanize their businesses and increase consumer trust.


## üí∞ Perks are often priced higher than cash fees

In 2025, while the average cash fees for Japanese Twitch influencers will range from ‚Çπ65,000-INR to ‚Çπ1,30,000-INR, perks brands provide will usually be valued higher.

### üéÆ Video games

The average prices for video games will cost brands much less than what they will pay Japanese Twitch influencers to promote them.

Video games will be valued around ‚Çπ5,000-INR each, so supplying popular game titles for several influencers can be a great investment. Also, if a game title is still new, it may be valued more.


### üé§ Game merchandise

Merchandise from popular game franchises can also help brands win over Japanese Twitch influencers.

Japanese Twitch influencers will value popular game merchandise more than video games.

Brands will need to provide merchandise worth around ‚Çπ7,500-INR each to get recognized.
