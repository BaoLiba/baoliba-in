As we approach 2025, discussions around TikTok's viability as a profitable platform for influencers and advertisers alike are becoming more prevalent.

TikTok has become a leading platform for influencer engagement and marketing in India, where brands like HDFC Bank and Ford have found success.

However, with platforms like Instagram and YouTube making strides in the short-form video realm, questions remain about whether TikTok can maintain its top spot.

## üì¢ Marketing

Influencer marketing has proven to be a profitable engagement strategy, with 75% of Indian marketers stating that influencer campaigns yield higher ROI than traditional marketing methods.

A recent report found that India has the highest influencer marketing growth rate in the world, growing at a staggering 25% annually.

Despite facing bans in several countries, TikTok is still leading the pack when it comes to influencer marketing in India, where it has been considered a catalyst for this growth.

Over 60% of marketers still deem TikTok as the leading influencer marketing platform in India, where they plan to focus their campaigns in 2025.

## üí° Tips

Creativity reigns supreme in the world of influencer marketing, and brands must stay ahead of the game if they wish to lead the pack.

Unlike traditional ads, influencer marketing relies heavily on authenticity, which means that brands must be genuine in their outreach.

While TikTok may still reign supreme as the platform of choice for influencer marketing in India, Instagram has the upper hand when it comes to authenticity.

According to a report, 67% of Indian marketers find Instagram's influencers more authentic than TikTok's.

Brands that wish to maintain their relevance in influencer marketing must consider this distinction, and integrate Instagram into their influencer marketing campaigns in 2025.

## üìä Data

Despite Instagram seeming to be the more authentic platform for influencer marketing, TikTok influencers are still generating higher engagement rates.

TikTok influencers show an impressive 18% engagement rate overall, with food and beverage and travel influencers generating even higher rates of 20% and 21% respectively.

In comparison, Instagram influencers see engagement rates ranging from 1% to 3%.

Engagement rates are one of the main metrics used to gauge influencer marketing success, with 66% of Indian marketers agreeing that it is the most important metric.

Despite Instagram's authenticity, TikTok's engagement rates give it the edge needed to maintain its leading position in influencer marketing by 2025.

## ‚ùó Risks

While TikTok still seems to be the preferred platform for influencer marketing in India, the reality is that markets can change quickly.

The rise of short-form video on platforms like Instagram and YouTube means that brands must also be aware of where their audiences are spending their time.

Despite TikTok's popularity and success in influencer marketing, brands must diversify their outreach by leveraging multiple platforms, including Instagram and YouTube, if they wish to maintain relevance in influencer marketing by 2025.
