In 2023, a sudden and unexpected rise of Indian LinkedIn influencers has emerged on Korea‚Äôs social media landscape. While it may seem odd that Korean netizens are taking advice from Indians, these influencers are bringing a sense of trust and reliability that locals appreciate.

Influencing across borders is not easy; it requires a real understanding of the nuances of culture and local sentiment. Fortunately, the Indians entering Korea‚Äôs business boardrooms seem to have mastered these challenges.

## üé¢ An Indian Influencer Makes His Entrance

It all began with a presentation.

In January, Indian influencer Aditya Shukla produced a video on LinkedIn detailing an encounter he had with a high-ranking Korean business executive.

The clip, which has racked up over a million views, shows how Aditya was given the cold shoulder at first due to a misunderstanding with the office receptionist, who believed he was an unwanted guest. After the receptionist cleared things up, the executive offered a comfortable chair for Aditya to sit in and even a warm cup of tea.  

After a brief hesitation, Aditya declined the tea and asked if the executive would prefer coffee. This simple gesture opened the door to a pleasant discussion about business collaboration and investment opportunities between Indian and Korean firms.  

In the end, the executive expressed his gratitude to Aditya for his tact and decorum by saying it was a pleasure meeting him.

Aditya later shared how he initially thought the reception was hostile but remained patient and calm as he navigated the misunderstanding.  

While the details of the meeting were important, it was the way Aditya conducted himself that impressed the netizens the most. The clip is still being posted in various comment sections, and it continues to guide professionals on how to better conduct themselves in the workplace.

## ‚ùì What's Going on?

Foreign influencers on Korean social media are not new, and the likes of famous YouTubers have entered the scene before. But it‚Äôs different for LinkedIn.  

Most of the content posted and exchanged on Korea‚Äôs LinkedIn platform is mundane and lacks character. Searching for meaningful insight is akin to looking for a needle in a haystack.  

Foreign content creators like Aditya are changing all of this.  

Korean influencers have risen up out of the depths and started reviving the platform by utilizing a new method of storytelling in their presentations. They are sharing their struggles and setbacks rather than always flaunting their successes.  

Whereas many Korean influencers spend unnecessary time polishing their videos to present the perfect image, Indian influencers are more concerned with telling a good story.  

Aditya is not the only Indian influencer bringing this new approach to Korea‚Äôs LinkedIn landscape.

## üí° What‚Äôs the Secret?

Indian influencer Neha Bansal, who is also based in Korea, has amassed over 65,000 followers on the platform in just a few months.  

Neha was born and raised in India, but she has been living in South Korea for a decade. In her posts, she shares her vast experiences and knowledge regarding not only the Korean market but also how Indian firms can prosper there.  

Neha tells the India Times that her insights have resonated with locals. She explains that Koreans have traditionally relied on their own for professional tips and insights.  

But now that Korean firms are looking to expand their market reach, they are turning to the likes of Neha for advice on entering India and building a bridge between the two cultures and countries.

## üì£ What Are They Saying?

While these Indian influencers are seeing success in Korea‚Äôs business circles, some locals are not so pleased.  

Korean LinkedIn influencer Jihoon Oh has been vocal about what he sees as a problem with foreigners entering the Korean LinkedIn scene. He recently tweeted, ‚ÄúThe data says that people from India and Indonesia are more active than Koreans in Korea LinkedIn. I think you need to be careful about foreigners who aren't in the right positions.‚Äù 

His comments seem to echo those of other locals who believe that Indians have no right to comment on the Korean business scene.  

But this sentiment is not universal.  

Although some locals are skeptical, many are excited that outsiders are introducing some much-needed variety to the platform.  

For example, Korean influencer Kyung Seok Jung stated, ‚ÄúKorean LinkedIn is dead. Indian and Indonesian people are bringing it back to life.‚Äù   

Indians are not just gaining traction on Korea‚Äôs LinkedIn platform; they are also storming the Korean gaming scene.  

In January, an Indian gaming influencer known as Kryptonian made headlines when he invited Korean professional PUBG player Pio to come to his home and show off his skills.  

Kryptonian shared how he had long admired Pio and his skills and wanted to meet him.  

The two met, and Pio was so impressed with Kryptonian's skills that he declared him a pro.  

Kryptonian‚Äôs YouTube channel has since exploded in popularity and garnered over 100,000 subscribers.

## ‚ùó Get In While You Can  

The likes of Aditya and Neha are still a novelty in Korea‚Äôs LinkedIn circles, but that will not last for long.   

As word spreads that Indian influencers are enjoying success in Korea, more will enter the scene.   

Indians looking to make their mark must act fast.   

Korea is a highly competitive market for influencers, and those who hesitate risk being crushed by those who take action.   

If you are an Indian influencer or someone looking to enter the exciting world of influencing, there is much to learn from those who are already there.   

Take a cue from Koreans and analyze what Indian influencers are doing.   

Koreans are not new to cross-border marketing efforts or influencers, and they have put up a strong defense against incursions from foreigners.   

They will only let you in if they think you have something valuable to offer.
