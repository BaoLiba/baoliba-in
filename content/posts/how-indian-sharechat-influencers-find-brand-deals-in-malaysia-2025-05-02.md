In recent months, ShareChat influencers from India have been discovered to be landing prestigious brand deals in Malaysia. This trend has alarmed Malaysian influencers, prompting them to question the local industry.

According to a recent article published by The Star Malaysia, several Malaysian companies have been hiring Indian influencers on ShareChat, a popular app in India.


## 📱 What’s ShareChat?

ShareChat is a short video platform that has gained immense popularity among the Indian audience. The app has been downloaded over 500 million times on the Google Play Store and receives 600 million daily video views. 

ShareChat allows creators to share videos in their chosen languages, including Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Punjabi, and many others. Despite being one of India’s most downloaded apps, it has not yet made its mark in international markets.

Though it is not as popular as TikTok in India, it has become an indispensable part of the Indian influencer ecosystem. In recent months, it has surpassed Instagram in the number of sponsored posts by influencers in the country.


## 🌍 How has ShareChat managed to gain a foothold in Malaysia?

Despite being a relatively new player, ShareChat has made inroads into the Malaysian influencer marketing landscape. Its popularity in India has trickled into Malaysia owing to the large Indian diaspora.

According to data from ShareChat’s parent company, Mohalla Tech, 48% of Malaysian Indians use the app. With 80% of ShareChat users being creators, the app boasts over 300,000 influencers in Malaysia alone.


## 🇲🇾 Why are Malaysian companies hiring Indian influencers on ShareChat?

Local influencers in Malaysia have expressed their concerns over how Indian influencers have been getting lucrative brand deals in Malaysia. 

In a recent post shared on the Malaysian influencer group on Facebook, a user pointed out how Indian influencers can stand out from the crowd and even get paid more than the locals.

According to the user, Malaysian companies are more inclined towards hiring Indian influencers because of their larger and more engaged audiences. 

They also tend to produce viral content that resonates with the brand values of Malaysian companies and their target customers. 

Finally, Indian influencers are cheaper to hire than their Malaysian counterparts, allowing companies to enjoy greater returns on investment.


## 💸 How do Indian influencers on ShareChat get paid?

According to an article from BusinessToday, the average cost of hiring an influencer from ShareChat is between 5,000 to 20,000 Indian Rupees (approximately 270 to 1,080 Malaysian Ringgit). 

Aside from getting paid in the local currency, Indian influencers on ShareChat can also receive payments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Tether.

While these two cryptocurrencies are illegal in India, they can still be used to pay Indian influencers based in Malaysia.


## 🏢 Do Malaysian companies hire Indian influencers directly from ShareChat?

According to a representative from ShareChat, influencers on their platform do not have to worry about finding brands themselves.

ShareChat has its own in-built influencer marketing platform called ShareChat for Business. 

This platform acts as a bridge between brands and influencers, allowing companies to find and partner with influencers quickly and efficiently.

Brands can set campaign goals, target specific audiences, and select influencers based on their niche and following. ShareChat for Business also provides analytics and insights to help brands track campaign performance.


## 🤝 How can Indian influencers work with Malaysian brands on ShareChat?

Indian influencers can also find brand deals in Malaysia through influencer marketing agencies. 

A prominent agency that specializes in recruiting influencers on ShareChat is BaoLiba. The agency has a reputation for connecting brands with top influencers across various platforms, including ShareChat.

With a dedicated team of influencer marketing experts, BaoLiba can help Indian influencers land prestigious brand deals not only in Malaysia but in other countries as well.

To get started, influencers can visit the BaoLiba website and fill out the application form. 

Once approved, the influencer will be assigned a talent manager who will work closely with them to understand their niche, audience, and goals. 

The talent manager will then connect the influencer with brands looking to collaborate with them.


## 👀 Conclusion

The rising popularity of ShareChat among Indian influencers is a testament to the app's growing importance in the Indian influencer ecosystem. 

As more and more influencers from India land brand deals in Malaysia, it seems that they hold the key to unlocking new opportunities for Malaysian companies.
