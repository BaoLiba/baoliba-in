Across the globe, YouTube influencers have emerged as an indispensable vessel for brands looking to broaden market penetration and enhance their reputation. With the rise of influencer marketing, platform personalities have taken it upon themselves to identify perfect brand matches. Similarly, Indian YouTubers have cemented their footprints in a plethora of countries, thanks to their business instincts and a robust understanding of diverse consumer cultures. 

Among countries that Indian YouTubers frequently target for brand deals is Thailand, given the Kingdom's status as a hub for international business expansion, its readiness to engage with non-local entrepreneurs, and its generous influencer compensation culture. However, effectively collaborating with Thai brands means understanding the microcosm of Thailand's business culture, along with the nuances of the influencer marketing ecosystem in the country. 

Here is a closer look at how Indian YouTube influencers have been snagging lucrative brand deals with Thai businesses: 

## üìä Potential Engagement Rates

Despite its relatively low population size of around 70 million people, Thailand boasts a staggering number of social media users‚Äîover 54 million. This gives the Kingdom an impressive engagement rate of 77%, representing the highest rate of social media users in Southeast Asia and the 10th rank in the world. 

It‚Äôs not surprising, therefore, that Thailand's influencer marketing segment is booming. Between 2023 and 2025, the influencer marketing market in Thailand is estimated to grow from $66 million to over $145 million dollars, exhibiting an annual growth rate of about 14.23%. 

Consequently, the average price for a brand deal with a Thai YouTuber increased by approximately 27% from 2019 to 2022, now standing at around THB 48,000 (INR 124,000) per advertisement. 

Additionally, with the average view count of successful Thai YouTube channels being around 500,000 views, brand deals in Thailand have become more enticing for Indian YouTubers. 

## üåç The Thai Market: A Fresh Frontier for Indian YouTubers

Compared to Western countries, the Thai market is relatively less saturated with Indian YouTubers. Therefore, for those willing to hustle, the potential for establishing a commanding presence in the Kingdom is significantly higher.

In fact, according to the Baoliba Influencer Marketing Group, Thailand presents one of the most promising markets for Indian influencer marketing, with the highest demand for Indian YouTubers expected to occur in the Kingdom relative to all Southeast Asian countries. 

At present, Thailand ranks fourth in the list of top Southeast Asian countries that brands are seeking to engage with Indian YouTubers.  

With approximately 90% of Thais familiar with India, and a significant Thai population traveling to India each year, Indian YouTubers have the advantage of being perceived as relatable compared to their Western influencers, making it easier for their audience to connect with their messages. 

## üìù Understanding Thailand's Influencer Marketing Landscape

In 2023, Thailand ranked as the eighth top influencer market in the world, with expectations of significant growth in its influencer marketing segment by 2025.  

The average follower count initially attracts many aspiring influencers. However, experts emphasize that success in this field demands more than vanity metrics.  

In Thailand, brands prioritize influencers who specialize in specific niches relevant to their business‚Äîthey aren‚Äôt looking for mega influencers but rather micro and nano influencers. This is similar to how Indian brands also target niche influencers, particularly among the vast pool of YouTube creators. 

Therefore, Indian YouTubers must identify the right niche that resonates with their audience. Some popular niches in Thailand include travel, lifestyle, pets, fashion, food, and beauty. 

## üíº The Business Etiquette in Thailand

Aside from niche specialization, Indian YouTubers must master the etiquette for success in Thailand's influencer marketing landscape. 

Previously, Indian YouTubers would often focus solely on their content when reaching out to Thai brands for collaborations. However, many of them still received no response or were outright ignored despite having high engagement. 

Consequently, they sought to understand what they were missing after consulting with successful Thai influencers. 

In Thailand, businesses often take extensive time to deliberate before making decisions. Therefore, follow-ups are typically required after influencer outreach. Unlike in India, where influencers may send multiple follow-up messages about their proposal, in Thailand, it's generally acceptable to send a single follow-up message after some time has passed, perhaps a week or more. 

Moreover, Thailand's collective cultural values often supersede individualism, meaning that influencers should work toward creating win-win deals for both parties involved. 

## üí∏ Payment Procedures for Brand Deals in Thailand

Similar to India, brand deals in Thailand often involve upfront payments. However, compared to India, Thai brands tend to charge lower product values, reserving higher financial valuations for cash payments. 

Therefore, Indian YouTube influencers must ensure that they have a payment method that is accessible to Thai brands. 

For instance, many Indian YouTubers rely on PayPal for cash payments. However, PayPal is quite limited in Thailand. On the other hand, although Wise is also limited, some Thai brands accept it, and many Indian YouTubers are already using Wise for payments in other Southeast Asian countries, such as Indonesia and the Philippines.   

Consequently, it might be worthwhile for Indian YouTubers to ensure that they offer both PayPal and Wise as payment options. 

## ü•≥ Marketing Companies in Thailand That Connect Indian YouTubers with Thai Brands

Due to the sociocultural differences between Thailand and India, many influencers and brands often find it challenging to expand into new markets. 

Consequently, influencer collaboration companies that assist brands in connecting with influencers have emerged. These companies act as intermediaries between influencers and brands to facilitate successful partnerships. 

Fortunately, Thailand has several reputable influencer marketing companies that work with Indian YouTubers. They include the following: 

- **OnFlik:** OnFlik is an influencer marketing agency with an office in Bangkok that helps brands connect with the right influencers in Thailand. It comprises a team of creative marketers focusing on social media and influencer marketing strategies to help brands reach their target audience effectively.  

- **HypeFast:** HypeFast is another influencer marketing agency with years of experience in the Thailand influencer marketing ecosystem. It specializes in organizing easy collaborations between influencers and brands. 

- **Buzzeff:** Buzzeff is a leading communication and media agency in Thailand that specializes in influencer marketing. Over the years, the company has forged strong relationships with genuine influencers, ensuring that its roster is made up of only credible personalities.  

- **Siam 2.0:** Siam 2.0 is a full-service influencer marketing and social media agency in Thailand. It connects brands with influencers while creating campaigns, organizing events, and offering other related services. 

## üéØ Researching Thai Brands for Potential Collaboration

Fortunately, there are several effective ways that Indian YouTubers can reach out to Thai brands directly for collaboration. They can conduct research to identify both local and international brands that have established presences in Thailand. 

For instance, Thai brands that claim a share of the international market often advertise on the English-language Thai website **Bangkok Post**. Therefore, the website is a great resource for discovering popular brands in Thailand. 

Furthermore, there are several comprehensive lists of top brands in Thailand for various industries that can be found online. YouTube influencers can leverage this information to build outreach lists for potential collaborations. 

According to Baoliba, some notable brands that have collaborated with Indian YouTubers in Thailand include the following: 

- **Coco Fresh Tea & Juice:** Coco Fresh Tea & Juice is a popular bubble tea franchise in Thailand with locations all over the Kingdom. The franchise has previously collaborated with many Indian YouTubers, including Ankur Pathak and Akash Sharma.  

- **EVEANDBOY:** EVEANDBOY is a leading beauty retailer in Thailand. The company has worked with several Indian YouTubers, including Vikas Sharma and Sunil Patil.

- **Lynaround:** Lynaround is a famous fashion brand in Thailand known for its stylish apparel. The brand has worked with various Indian YouTubers, including Vikas Sharma and Ankur Pathak. 

- **Viva Skin, Hair & Health Clinic:** Viva Skin, Hair & Health Clinic is a famous cosmetic clinic in Thailand whose services include botox treatments and laser hair removal. The clinic has previously collaborated with Indian YouTuber, Sahil Khurana.

## üì± Leveraging Social Media for Outreach

Social media is another avenue Indian YouTube influencers can use to connect with Thai brands for collaboration. Instagram, in particular, is popular among Thai brands for marketing their products and creating brand awareness. 

As such, Indian YouTubers can leverage Instagram to identify brands in Thailand that align with their niche and messaging. Hashtags are a great way to search on Instagram. 

Some examples of relevant hashtags include **#ThailandBrand**, **#ThailandBrands**, **#ThailandMarket**, **#ThaiBusiness**, **#MadeInThailand**, and **#ThailandShopping**. 

Furthermore, it is important to research a brand‚Äôs requirements and procedures before reaching out. For example, some brands may require influencers to complete a form before receiving a response.  

Therefore, if an Indian YouTuber goes through this process and is well aligned with a brand's vision, they will significantly increase their chances of securing a collaboration. 

## üåê Targeting Thai Brands on Video Platforms

Another channel that Indian YouTube influencers can utilize to discover and connect with brands in Thailand is the video platform **TikTok**. 

Primarily targeting Gen Z and young adults, TikTok is hugely popular among younger Thais. In fact, according to Statista, as of 2023, Thailand ranks as the fifth most TikTok-obsessed country in the world. 

TikTok has a unique search function that allows users to find specific videos using keywords, hashtags, and user handles. By entering the keywords **Thailand** and **brand** into the search bar, Indian YouTubers can discover clips featuring various Thai brands. 

Moreover, TikTok has a more relaxed and personal environment compared to Instagram. Indian YouTubers can thus utilize TikTok‚Äôs social features, such as messaging and comments sections, to reach out to businesses in Thailand. 

## ‚ùóChallenges Indian YouTubers Might Face in Thailand

Despite the many opportunities for Indian YouTube influencers to collaborate with brands in Thailand, several challenges can hinder their success.  

One major issue is the language barrier. While English is the international language of business, many Thai brands primarily rely on the Thai language when communicating. 

Although some Thai businesses have English-speaking representatives, many do not. Therefore, to successfully engage with a Thai brand, Indian YouTubers must be prepared to invest in translator services.  

Additionally, the legal systems of Thailand and India may differ significantly. Several laws and regulations governing influencer marketing exist in Thailand that Indian YouTubers may not be aware of. 

Consequently, to ensure compliance and protection, it is advisable for Indian YouTube influencers to consult with a Thai lawyer before engaging in any brand collaborations. 

## üìà Conclusion

Thai businesses are increasingly recognizing the impact of influencer marketing as a powerful strategy for reaching their target audience. Despite being relatively new to the scene compared to the Western world, Thailand's influencer marketing ecosystem is rapidly maturing, presenting more opportunities for Indian YouTubers to secure lucrative brand deals. 

Nonetheless, Indian influencers must be aware of the challenges they may encounter, particularly when it comes to the language barrier and legal frameworks. Nevertheless, given the immense size of the influencer marketing pie in Thailand, Indian YouTubers can confidently explore this promising market with the right approach.
