Indian brands have recognized both the rapid rise of South Korean pop culture and the potential of social media when it comes to marketing. Collaborations with Korean influencers tend to gain traction and reach the right audiences.

With that in mind, have you considered collaborating with Korean Tumblr influencers? Tumblr is still a wildly popular platform with over 435 million active users a month, especially in South Korea where it boasts over 50% of the Korean population as active users. 

This post is partially a guide on how to collaborate with Korean Tumblr influencers and the pricing required for these collaborations.

## üìä How Influencer Collaborations Work on Tumblr in Korea

Influencer marketing on Tumblr operates similarly to other mainstream social media platforms like Instagram or Facebook, but some unique practices are involved.

Here are some of the most common types of influencer collaborations on Tumblr:

- **Sponsored Posts**: Influencers will create a post about your brand or product and tag it with various hashtags. Then depending on your requirements, the influencer may also share that post on other social platforms like Instagram, Twitter or Facebook. 
- **Affiliate Marketing**: Influencers can also promote your brand or product using affiliate links. They will get a cut of every sale generated through the link.
- **Paid Promotions**: Influencers will simply post an image or video that promotes your brand and requires no further action from them.
- **Product Reviews**: Influencers will receive your product and review it to their followers. This could be in the form of images, videos, and text, depending on the influencer‚Äôs strengths.
- **Giveaways**: Influencers can host giveaways that require followers to perform several actions to qualify. This tactic often boosts engagement.
- **Brand Ambassadors**: A more long-term collaboration where the influencer will regularly promote your brand and products.

## üí° Pricing of Korean Tumblr Influencers

Korean Tumblr influencers may charge varying fees depending on their popularity and audience reach. But on average, you can expect pricing like the following:

- **Sponsored Posts**: 800,000 Wons per post
- **Affiliate Marketing**: 10% per sale converted through the affiliate link
- **Paid Promotions**: 400,000 Wons
- **Product Reviews**: Minimum 300,000 Wons
- **Giveaways**: 200,000 Wons
- **Brand Ambassadors**: 1,000,000 Wons per month

Converting Korean Wons to Indian Rupees, you can expect to spend anywhere between 12,000 to 20,000 Rupees maximum to collaborate with Korean Tumblr influencers.

## üîç Finding Korean Tumblr Influencers

While many marketing agencies specialize in influencer marketing, they may not have strong ties with Korean Tumblr influencers. As an alternative, you can follow these steps to find popular Korean Tumblr influencers:

1. **Search for keywords related to your brand or product** on Tumblr. This will show you posts from various influencers. Once you find influencers you like, check their statistics to see if they are worth collaborating with. 
2. **Use influencer marketing platforms**. Though most platforms offer influencers from various platforms, some specialize in specific platforms like Tumblr. 
3. **Hire a Korean influencer marketing agency**. Many agencies specialize in connecting brands with influencers in Korea, particularly on Tumblr. They may have a price of their own, but working with an agency takes a load off your shoulders.

## üì¢ Payment to Korean Tumblr Influencers

Cash payments are still the most reliable payment method to pay Korean Tumblr influencers.

But if required, many Korean influencers can also accept payments through PayPal, cryptocurrencies, and other online payment gateways.

If you are collaborating with an agency, they may have their own payment method to provide you with greater peace of mind.

## üí° Conclusion

The allure of Korean pop culture has crept into Indian hearts, and Indian brands are capitalizing on that attraction by leveraging influencer marketing in Korea.

While Korean Tumblr influencers may not be as popular as Youtube or Instagram influencers in Korea, their influencer power remains strong in specific niches.

If you are planning on collaborating with Korean Tumblr influencers, be prepared to pay an average of around 12,000 to 20,000 Rupees depending on the influencer‚Äôs popularity. 

Whether you want to have a sponsored post or have them host a giveaway, Korean Tumblr influencers have your back!
