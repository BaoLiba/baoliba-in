The social media platform scene in India is wildly different from that of China, especially when it comes to influencer marketing.  

While Western platforms like Instagram and TikTok dominate the conversation around influencer marketing in India, the Chinese e-commerce platform Taobao has developed a unique model that is being emulated in India.  

The rise of influencers on Taobao has shaped the way people in China shop‚Äîand the way marketers advertise products.  

Shopping through live streams is quickly catching on with Indian consumers, thanks to a growing number of entertaining and relatable Indian influencers on platforms like Meesho, Bulbul, and Shopmatic.  

Just like the influencers on Taobao, influencers on these platforms have the same opportunity to monetize their channels by collaborating with brands.  

One of the biggest questions business owners must grapple with when it comes to influencer collaborations is how much influencers charge to collaborate.  

This is especially important for brands on a budget or startups who have not yet made a name for themselves in their respective industries.  

In this article, we will outline the pricing standards Taobao influencers charge to collaborate and highlight how Indian influencers on local platforms stack up to their Chinese counterparts.   

## üí∞ Pricing Standards Taobao Influencers Charge to Collaborate  

- **1-2 Million Followers:** $45-200 per collaboration  
- **2-10 Million Followers:** $600-1,600 per collaboration  
- **10+ Million Followers:** Upwards of $2,500 per collaboration  
    
The above price ranges are for Taobao influencers only and do not include celebrities or major KOLs.   

According to an article published by the Chinese magazine Gala, Taobao influencers with under 1 million followers usually charge no more than 3000 yuan ($390) per collaboration.  

After amassing a following of about 1 million, influencers can start charging upwards of 20,000 yuan ($2,600) per collaboration.  

**Taobao influencers charge about $300 for flash sales, $5,000 for 1-5 minutes, and $6,000 for 10 minutes or more of advertisement time.** 

## üîç Factors Influencing Pricing  


While the above figures provide a solid overview of pricing standards used by Taobao influencers, there are many factors that can influence the final price, including:  

- **Length of collaboration**  
- **Type of product being promoted**  
- **Daily traffic and sales revenue of the influencer‚Äôs page**   
- **Platform they are using to promote the product**  

### üìâ Length of Collaboration  

The longer the collaboration, the higher the price will be.  

For example, if a clothing brand books a Taobao influencer for a live stream session, they can expect to pay anywhere from $300 to upwards of $5,000 based on how long they want the influencer to promote their products.  

### üì¶ Type of Product Being Promoted  

The type of product being promoted is another factor that affects pricing.  

A clothing company trying to collaborate with a Taobao influencer will pay a different price than a luxury cosmetics or jewelry brand.  

This is because these high-end products yield larger margins compared to clothing, so brands have more flexibility when it comes to pricing.  

### üõí Daily Traffic and Sales Revenue of Influencer‚Äôs Page  

The daily revenue of the influencer‚Äôs page can greatly affect the price they charge.  

For example, a Taobao influencer who primarily sells clothing and makes hundreds of thousands of dollars daily might charge a higher price to collaborate compared to an influencer in the cosmetics space who makes only a few thousand dollars a day.  

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Platform Influencer Uses to Promote the Product  

Finally, the platform that the influencer promotes the products on can also affect their pricing.  

For example, an influencer who promotes products solely on Taobao Live will likely charge a lower price than one who promotes them on various platforms, including Weibo and Douyin.  

## üõçÔ∏è How Indian Influencers Stack Up  

According to an article published by The Week, Indian beauty influencers charge anywhere from 10,000 to 2 million rupees ($121-$242,900) for sponsored posts on Instagram.   

By comparison, Taobao influencers seem to be far more accessible, with many charging as little as $45 per collaboration.  

However, the Chinese platform guarantees more lifetime value for brands through its extensive funnel and better audience retention and engagement, which makes it more competitive than local platforms in India.  

**In a bid to replicate this success, Indian platforms like Meesho, Bulbul, and Shopmatic are implementing live shopping experiences on their platforms.**  

As for pricing standards, influencers on these Indian platforms seem to charge a more competitive price than their Taobao counterparts, at least when it comes to beauty influencers.  

Meesho beauty influencers charge anywhere from 500 to 3000 rupees ($6-$36.52) for products that would normally cost 15,000 rupees ($182) and above.   

### üìπ Meesho Influencer Pricing  

According to a recent article published by Business Today, Meesho influencers charge as little as 500 rupees ($6) for beauty products worth Rs 15,000 ($182).    
The platform aims to bring live commerce to every smartphone in the country, which explains their affordability.   

For example, a Meesho influencer will likely charge brands an average of 4,000 rupees ($49) for a sponsored post compared to 6,500 rupees ($79) or more for an influencer on Bulbul or Shopmatic.  

However, Bulbul influencers charge considerably less than Taobao influencers.  

### üìπ Bulbul Influencer Pricing  

According to a recent article published by PhocusWire, Bulbul influencers charge approximately 25-30% of what influencers charge on established platforms like Instagram and TikTok.   
For example, Bulbul influencers charge anywhere from 300 rupees ($3.65) to 2000 rupees ($24.38) per collaboration, making them much more competitive than their Taobao counterparts.   

### üìπ Shopmatic Influencer Pricing  

Shopmatic influencers charge as much as 15% of what influencers charge on more established platforms like Instagram.   

According to their website, influencers on Shopmatic charge anywhere from 900 to 5,000 rupees for 3 to 8 minutes of exposure time.  

Their pricing highlights the value of the innovation they are bringing to the influencer marketing table.  

**The prices above reflect the standards Bulbul and Shopmatic influencers charge for product promotions that normally retail for upwards of 30,000 rupees ($365).**  

## ‚öñÔ∏è Conclusion  

While the pricing standards Taobao influencers charge are generally lower than Indian influencers on local platforms, the former can provide much more value due to their extensive funnel and better audience retention and engagement.  

If Indian influencers can replicate this model, they will be able to charge more per collaboration while still providing significant value for brands looking to promote their products.  

The competitive pricing of Indian influencers, especially those on newer platforms, may be temporary and could change in a few years once they fully establish themselves in the market.  

For the time being, brands can take advantage of lower pricing while leveraging the same strategies that Taobao influencers have found success with over the years.  

**As platforms like Meesho, Bulbul, and Shopmatic continue to grow in popularity and innovate, businesses can expect influencer marketing to evolve rapidly in the coming years.**
