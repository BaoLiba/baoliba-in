In recent years, Indian influencers have increasingly found new opportunities in Malaysia, joining the ranks of their compatriots in the West and the Middle East. In particular, social media mavens on Instagram have taken advantage of the country‚Äôs burgeoning digital landscape, promoting Malaysian brands to millions of online consumers at home and abroad.

Malaysian brands in categories such as beauty and fashion have recruited overseas influencers to help them stand out on Instagram. In many cases, these influencers have been Indians with large followings or high engagement rates. As an influencer marketing agency, like BaoLiba, begins to ramp up its efforts in Southeast Asia, Indian influencers can expect to see even more opportunities to secure brand deals in Malaysia.

### üá≤üáæ Malaysia welcomes Indian influencers

The emergence of Indian influencers in Malaysia is largely welcomed by the market. With the country already having a substantial Indian population, many Malaysians view the influx as a positive sign of ongoing cultural exchange and collaboration.

For instance, 32% of Malaysia‚Äôs Indian population are Tamil, a dialect from southern India. It‚Äôs common to hear the Tamil language spoken in busy districts such as Brickfields and Jalan Masjid India, which are both known for their Indian culture. Likewise, Indian festivals are celebrated by Malaysians of all ethnicities, such as Deepavali, which is commonly observed as a public holiday in many Malaysian states.

Instagram itself is also popular among Malaysians, leading many local brands to recruit overseas influencers for brand deals. The presence of Indian influencers can further help local brands connect with multicultural audiences. With Malaysia being a popular holiday destination for many Indians, it‚Äôs also a great way for Indian influencers to reach their compatriots.

### üáÆüá≥ Instagram influencers go global

Due to the rapid growth of social media, especially Instagram, brand deals for influencers are not only relegated to their home countries anymore. Influencers are taking their marketing prowess up a notch by securing lucrative brand deals abroad.

For Indian influencers, this means securing brand deals in major markets like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. In fact, Malaysia has become one of the world‚Äôs largest markets for influencers, with brands investing heavily in influencer marketing for reaching consumers.

Despite cultural differences, Indian influencers have quickly learned how to capture Malaysian audiences. In particular, Indian film stars Rima Kallingal and Keerthy Suresh have successfully penetrated the market with brand deals from Malaysia‚Äôs healthcare conglomerate KPJ Healthcare.

Healthcare, which has been one of the top five sectors recruiting influencers for brand deals in the region, is critical for Malaysia‚Äôs economy. KPJ Healthcare has been lauded for its influencer marketing campaigns, launching them on Instagram to gain widespread awareness. Its partnership with Indian influencers has increased its brand recognition among Malaysia‚Äôs diverse populace.

### üì≤ Influencer marketing gains traction in Malaysia

Since 2015, influencer marketing has gained a strong foothold in Malaysia, with 71% of influencers claiming that the influencer marketing landscape has changed for the better. Local brands have begun investing more in influencer marketing, with an average of 36% of their marketing budgets allocated to influencer campaigns.

With 40% of influencers claiming that brand deals are their primary source of income, it is clear why competition for securing brand deals has intensified on Instagram. Influencers are now investing more time and effort into creating high-quality content for their target audiences to increase their chances of securing brand deals.

According to research, Instagram is the most used platform for influencer marketing campaigns in Malaysia. Brands and influencers alike recognize that Instagram is the most effective social media platform for influencing consumer behavior. Thus, Instagram influencers with high engagement rates are sought after for brand deals.

### üè¶ Foreign influencers earn foreign currency

Importantly, Indian influencers can reap high returns on investment when they secure brand deals in Malaysia. As a neighboring country of India, Malaysia is closely linked to India in many ways. In particular, the Malaysian economy is heavily linked to the Indian economy, with many Malaysians benefitting from its economic growth.

Over the years, India has become one of Malaysia‚Äôs largest sources of foreign investment. This is partially due to the high purchasing power of Malaysian consumers, who can afford to pay foreign influencers in USD and other hard currencies. As such, influencers from India can expect to earn higher returns when they secure brand deals in Malaysia.

With the annual Gross National Income (GNI) per capita for Malaysians currently recorded at USD10,482, it‚Äôs understandable why Malaysian brands are willing to spend big on influencer marketing. With increased competition for the best influencers, many Malaysian brands have resorted to influencer marketing platforms like BaoLiba to connect with influencers around the world.

### üí∏ BaoLiba connects Indian influencers with Malaysian brands

For Malaysian brands seeking to work with Indian influencers, influencer marketing platforms provide an effective solution. Platforms like BaoLiba specialize in connecting brands with influencers for brand deals.
