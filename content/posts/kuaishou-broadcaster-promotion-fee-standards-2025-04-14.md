If you want to market to Chinese audiences in 2025, a Kuaishou influencer is the best influencer to hire. 

When comparing Kuaishou and Douyin, Kuaishou influencers are more relatable, and they boast a higher engagement rate on average. This is probably because Kuaishou is not as popular as Douyin, and thus more Kuaishou influencers, and ultimately their followers, are still on the lookout for new waves.

However, the downside here is that Kuaishou influencers are generally less experienced in working with global brands. This means that when collaborating with Kuaishou influencers, Indian brands may have a steeper learning curve than when they work with Douyin influencers or influencers from other brands.

Since influencer marketing is already the preferred marketing strategy for many brands in India, the Kuaishou influencer marketing strategy should be the next wave. But just how much does it cost to collaborate with a Kuaishou influencer?

In this article, we unpack Kuaishou influencer marketing, and find out how much it costs to collaborate with Kuaishou influencers for Indian brands in 2025.

## üì∫ Kuaishou Influencer Marketing

Kuaishou is a Chinese short video sharing platform owned by Kuaishou Technology. It is the second most popular video-sharing platform in China, after Douyin.

Kuaishou allows users to upload short 15-second videos, live streams, and to interact with other users on the platform. It‚Äôs very similar to TikTok, especially since Tiktok is the Chinese version of Douyin. 

Unlike Douyin though, Kuaishou takes pride in being the more grassroots version of short video sharing apps. Many Kuaishou influencers are average everyday folk that share their lives with each other, primarily through vlogs. 

As such, Kuaishou influencers are seen to be more relatable, and therefore more trustworthy by their audience. 

This makes influencer marketing on Kuaishou to be more effective compared to other influencer marketing strategies on other platforms, including Douyin. 

Some more statistics to illustrate Kuaishou‚Äôs influencer marketing advantage are:
1. Kuaishou was the 10th most downloaded social app in the world in 2023.
2. Kuaishou recorded over 300 million daily active users in 2022.
3. Kuaishou boasts over 1.1 billion monthly active users.
4. Kuaishou had over 200 million hours of content watched daily in 2023.
5. Kuaishou is the 7th most popular app in China, and the 28th most popular app in the world. 

## üí∞Kuaishou Influencer Costs

If the influence and engagement rates of Kuaishou influencers are impressive, and they are, that‚Äôs because they are not that cheap. 

On Kuaishou, the most experienced influencers can charge anywhere from $1,500, to as high as $10,000 for a single post or live stream. 

This is the high end of Kuaishou influencer costs. The low end of Kuaishou influencer costs can recruit influencers for anywhere between $20 to $500 - again for a single post or live stream.

If it sounds a little weird billing Kuaishou influencer costs by single post or live stream, that‚Äôs because Kuaishou influencers are often know to charge for both.

When a Kuaishou influencer promotes a brand, they usually post and stream at the same time. This means that viewers are able to interact with the influencer in real-time during the streaming session, and at the same time browse sponsored content on the influencer‚Äôs posts.

For Indian brands that have medium budgets, Kuaishou influencer marketing may be the perfect fit.

The average cost for Kuaishou influencers to promote brands and products is about $400. 

Here‚Äôs a more detailed breakdown of Kuaishou influencer costs according to their follower counts:

1. Kuaishou influencers with 1K - 10K followers charge between $20 to $200 per post or live stream.
2. Kuaishou influencers with 10K - 50K followers charge between $200 to $500 per post or live stream.
3. Kuaishou influencers with 50K - 100K followers charge between $500 to $1,200 per post or live stream.
4. Kuaishou influencers with 100K - 500K followers charge between $1,200 to $4,000 per post or live stream.
5. Kuaishou influencers with 500K - 1M followers charge between $4,000 to $8,000 per post or live stream.
6. Kuaishou influencers with over 1M followers charge between $8,500 to $10,000 per post or live stream.

## üìàKuaishou Influencer Costs Compared to Douyin and TikTok Influencer Costs

When it comes to influencer marketing on short video platforms, Kuaishou influencers are not only the most preferred; they are also the cheapest.

For instance, Douyin influencers with 1M followers and up, can cost anywhere between $15,000 to $30,000 for a single post or live stream! TikTok influencers with 1M followers and up can cost anywhere between $8,000 to $20,000. 

In essence, Kuaishou influencers are the better investment. And when Indian brands begin to realize this, Kuaishou influencer marketing will take off to unprecedented heights.

Research shows that internet penetration into the rural areas of China is expected to reach about 59% by 2025. This means that a Kuaishou influencer marketing strategy would be the most effective campaign that Indian brands can implement to penetrate the vast rural audience market in China.

Kuaishou is also expected to see revenues from live e-commerce and advertising grow by at least 30% by 2025. 

We can also expect that Kuaishou will become the number one short video sharing platform in the world in 2025, as it is projected that Douyin‚Äôs daily active users will drop by about 50 million.
