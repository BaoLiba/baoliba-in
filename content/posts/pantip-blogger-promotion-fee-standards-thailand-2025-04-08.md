## ‚öñÔ∏è Advertising Rules and Regulations on Pantip

Because Pantip lacks regulations on advertising and promotions, Thai influencers make promotions very subtle in a way that feels natural and organic.

They abide by the site‚Äôs rules by not posting threads that seem too advertorial in tone. For example, they can‚Äôt post about a product or service that is blatantly promotional or that features a call-to-action link.

Brands and influencers can agree on how to portray the product or service in a review. But, the influencer will have more creative freedom in bringing authenticity to their promotions.

The threads will often end up as informal testimonials and light reviews rather than direct commercials. This is where the relatability comes in.

This organic quality makes this avenue for influencer marketing more attractive to audiences that look for trustworthy opinions when deciding which item to buy.


## üí≥ Methods of Payment on Pantip

Pantip has its own payment service through which influencers can receive their payments. Shippers and sellers can also use this service for their transactions.

Using the ‚ÄúPantip Wallet‚Äù service makes transactions easy because it can connect to a Thai bank account or a payment service like LINE Pay. 

Once the payment is made, the influencer can then fulfill their end of the bargain. They can post the promotional thread for the product or service being marketed.

The influencer will also need to maintain a good standing with Pantip‚Äôs rules and regulations. If they are warned or banned for repeatedly violating these rules, they would not receive payments for their work.


## ‚úçüèª Conclusion
