If you‚Äôre an Indian creator or brand looking to crack the Malaysian market via LinkedIn, listen up. In 2025, the game‚Äôs getting more nuanced but also more rewarding ‚Äî provided you know how to play your cards right. Indian LinkedIn influencers are no longer just making noise in their backyard; many are bagging brand deals from Malaysia‚Äôs buzzing corporate and startup scenes, leveraging LinkedIn‚Äôs unique professional vibe.

So how exactly are they finding these deals? What‚Äôs working on the ground? And how can you replicate that success? This article breaks down the real-talk, hands-on strategies Indian influencers are using to win brand collaborations in Malaysia through LinkedIn ‚Äî all while navigating India‚Äôs payment systems, legal frameworks, and cultural nuances.

## üì¢ The LinkedIn Advantage for Indian Influencers Eyeing Malaysia

Unlike Instagram or YouTube where it's all about entertainment, LinkedIn is the *business zone*. In India, LinkedIn has exploded with professionals, entrepreneurs, and corporate honchos who actually want to engage with thought leaders.

For Indian influencers with a niche in tech, marketing, finance, or leadership, LinkedIn is the perfect place to get noticed by Malaysian companies hunting for credible voices to amplify their brand message in South-East Asia.

Take the example of Neha Sharma, a Bangalore-based B2B marketing coach with 50k+ LinkedIn followers. In 2025, she secured multiple brand deals with Malaysian SaaS startups looking to penetrate the Indian market. How? By posting insightful content on cross-border marketing challenges and tagging relevant Malaysian execs and firms.

## üí° How Indian Influencers Actually Land Brand Deals on LinkedIn in Malaysia

### 1. Targeted Content with Malaysia-Relevant Hooks

Indian influencers don‚Äôt just post generic stuff. They create content that resonates with Malaysian business culture ‚Äî emphasizing collaboration, innovation, and regional growth. For instance, talking about India-Malaysia relations, ASEAN market opportunities, or digital transformation trends specific to Malaysia.

This local flavour grabs the attention of Malaysian marketing managers scrolling through LinkedIn feeds.

### 2. Strategic Networking and Direct Outreach

It‚Äôs not just about posting. Indian influencers actively use LinkedIn‚Äôs ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù and ‚ÄúFilter by Location‚Äù features to find Malaysian brand managers, CMOs, and startup founders. Then, they send polite but direct InMails or connection requests, sometimes including a short pitch deck or media kit.

It helps that Indian professionals are culturally respectful, often starting conversations with greetings in Malay or mentioning shared South Asian values, which builds rapport quickly.

### 3. Leveraging India‚Äôs Payment and Legal Ecosystem for Smooth Deals

When the deal is on the table, Indian influencers push for payments via internationally accepted methods like PayPal, Wise, or direct bank wire transfers in Indian Rupees (INR) or Malaysian Ringgit (MYR).

Understanding Indian GST (Goods and Services Tax) implications and Malaysia‚Äôs tax treaties is key here. Many Indian influencers work with local CA or tax consultants to ensure invoicing and compliance are spot on ‚Äî no one wants the headache of double taxation.

### 4. Collaborating with India-Based Platforms and Agencies

Platforms like **BaoLiba** and agencies such as **Chtrbox India** have started bridging Indian influencers with Malaysian advertisers. These platforms offer campaign management, payment processing, and even legal support, making cross-border deals hassle-free.

Neha Sharma, mentioned earlier, credits BaoLiba‚Äôs Malaysia-India campaign support for helping her close deals worth lakhs of INR within months.

## üìä Case Study: Indian LinkedIn Influencer Bagging Malaysian Brand Deals in 2025

Meet Rohit Mehta, a Mumbai-based fintech influencer with a sharp focus on digital banking trends. By mid-2025, he had:

- 70k LinkedIn followers primarily from India, Malaysia, and Singapore  
- Engaged in collaborations with two Malaysian digital wallet startups  
- Earned ‚Çπ12 lakhs from brand partnerships, paid mostly via Wise transfers in MYR  

Rohit‚Äôs secret? He created LinkedIn posts analyzing fintech regulatory changes in Malaysia and casually mentioned the startups involved. He also joined LinkedIn groups focusing on ASEAN fintech and participated in discussions, organically attracting attention from Malaysian marketing teams.

## ‚ùó Common Pitfalls Indian Influencers Should Avoid When Targeting Malaysia

- **Overselling Indian Market Size:** Malaysian brands want genuine insights, not inflated hype. Be real with data and experiences.  
- **Ignoring Cultural Nuances:** Use respectful, localized language. Avoid direct translations or India-centric references that can alienate Malaysian audiences.  
- **Payment Terms Confusion:** Align payment expectations early ‚Äî currency, tax deductions, timelines ‚Äî to prevent delays.  
- **Skipping Legal Checks:** India and Malaysia have different advertising laws; ensure contracts protect intellectual property and content rights.
