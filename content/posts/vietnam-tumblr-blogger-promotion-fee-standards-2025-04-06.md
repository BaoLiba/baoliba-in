Tumblr is an underrated platform for influencer marketing in Vietnam. In this article, you will discover how much these creatives charge for their promotional collaborations.

## üìà Tumblr is still popular among Vietnamese youth

Vietnam has a burgeoning youth culture that is steadily embracing Western trends. As a result, popular culture among Vietnamese youth is heavily influenced by Western subcultures. Tumblr is the birthplace of many Western trends, like vapism and e-girls, and Vietnamese youth often refer to Tumblr in passing, such as when they sport vapist fashion or e-girl makeup. 

Despite the ban of Tumblr in Vietnam in 2018, many Vietnamese youth are still active on Tumblr through VPNs, and some of the most famous Vietnamese Tumblr influencers have garnered significant followings. As a result, Tumblr influencers are a goldmine for promoting brands targeting Vietnam‚Äôs youth market.

## üí∞ Tumblr influencers charge less than influencers on comparable platforms

Vietnamese Tumblr influencers are quirky, passionate, and packed full of personality. They produce captivating content that appeals to the whims of Vietnamese youth. However, unlike other influencers, such as those on Instagram, Tumblr influencers may charge lower rates for promotional collaborations. 

For instance, in Vietnam, average Instagram influencers charge around $300 for a sponsored post, while average Tumblr influencers charge only about $80 for the same post.

In fact, the Tumblr influencer marketing industry as a whole is considered to be a lot cheaper than other platforms like Instagram and TikTok. In 2025, it is predicted that TikTok influencers will charge upwards of $500 for a sponsored post aimed at Vietnamese youth, while Instagram influencers will charge at least $350 for the same post.  

## üìä Influencer pricing is on the rise

Like many other influencer markets around the world, the influencer pricing market in Vietnam is on the rise. The increase in influencer rates is expected to continue over the coming years as more brands recognize the potential of influencer marketing. In 2025, it is expected that influencers in Vietnam will charge an average of $140 for a sponsored post on Tumblr, $550 for a TikTok post, and $420 for an Instagram post. 

Despite this upward trend, Tumblr influencers are still expected to be the cheapest influencer group targeting Vietnam's youth market in 2025.

## üôå Popular brands often collaborate with Tumblr influencers

Many popular brands in Vietnam frequently collaborate with Tumblr influencers to reach Vietnam‚Äôs youth market. 

For instance, young fashion brand Chao Gai frequently collaborates with popular Vietnamese Tumblr influencers like @hchulie and @duongluongxuan. 

Chao Gai caters to the fashion needs of Vietnam's youth market by regularly hiring various influencers to promote their brand across various platforms. 

While Chao Gai is primarily based on Instagram and TikTok, they have also hired some popular Tumblr influencers among their ranks. 

## üéè Tumblr influencer marketing agencies can be useful 

If you are looking to tap into the Vietnamese Tumblr influencer marketing trend, you may want to check out some reputable influencer marketing agencies that cater to Tumblr influencers in Vietnam. 

One such agency is Gossip Vietnam. Gossip Vietnam is an influencer marketing agency that specializes in Instagram and TikTok influencers, but they also cater to Tumblr influencers by employing some of the most popular ones among their ranks. 

Another reputable influencer marketing agency catering to Tumblr influencers is Vina Influencer. Vina Influencer also specializes in Instagram and TikTok influencers, but they also offer some Tumblr influencer options to brands looking to reach Vietnam's youth market. 

## üí≥ Payment methods are reliable 

When collaborating with Vietnamese Tumblr influencers, expect to transact through direct bank deposits or reputable third-party platforms like PayPal and Paypal alternatives. 

For PayPal alternatives, consider apps like Payoneer and Wise, as they are some of the most popular money transfer apps among Vietnamese people. 

Another payment method would be cryptocurrency. Many Vietnamese people use cryptocurrency as a reliable and fast payment method, especially when dealing with international transactions. 

## ‚ùó Legal considerations 

Although influencer marketing is legal in Vietnam, some influencer marketing practices may lead to legal repercussions. 

For instance, influencers should disclose to followers when a post or video is sponsored. Failure to do so may lead to influencers being fined up to $60,000 for a fraudulent advertisement. 

In addition, influencers should not promote any products that are illegal in Vietnam, such as illegal drugs and prostitution services. 

Promoting such products may lead to influencers being fined or jailed for administrative violations.  

However, no law mandates influencer rates. Thus, hiring influencers in Vietnam is still pretty flexible regarding their pricing preferences.
