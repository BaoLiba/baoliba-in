Making a steady 10K income per month in India using Josh might sound like a pipe dream for many creators and brands. But trust me, it‚Äôs not some magic or luck ‚Äî it‚Äôs about knowing the game, playing your cards right, and hustling smart. As someone neck-deep in India‚Äôs influencer marketing scene, I‚Äôm here to drop the real-deal, street-smart guide on how you can cash in on Josh, the hyperlocal short-video app dominating the desi social space in 2025.

India‚Äôs social media space is buzzing, and Josh is one of the hottest platforms where brands and creators are meeting eyeballs and revenue. But making money on Josh ain‚Äôt just about posting random videos and praying for likes. Let‚Äôs get down to business.

## üì¢ Why Josh Is a Goldmine for Influencer Marketing in India

Josh has exploded in India, especially post the TikTok ban, becoming the go-to app for short videos in local languages. By May 2025, it‚Äôs clocking millions of active users daily, primarily from tier 2 and tier 3 cities. For influencers and brands looking to earn online, Josh offers:

- Massive reach in vernacular content  
- Lower competition compared to Instagram or YouTube  
- Easy monetization options via brand deals and affiliate marketing  
- Integrated payment methods like UPI, Paytm, and direct bank transfers in INR  

Unlike global platforms, Josh‚Äôs algorithm favors regional creators, making it easier to build a niche audience and convert followers into paying customers.

## üí° How to Make 10K per Month on Josh: A Step-By-Step Playbook

### 1. Pick Your Niche and Language: Local is King

India is a vast, diverse market ‚Äî content that slaps in Hindi won‚Äôt necessarily click in Telugu or Marathi. Josh‚Äôs strength lies in hyperlocal content. Focus on a niche you know well: be it beauty, tech gadgets, devotional content, or even desi food hacks. The more regional flavour you bring, the better your audience engagement and brand collaboration chances.

### 2. Build a Loyal Community, Not Just Followers

Brands in India value engagement over vanity numbers. Post consistently, interact with your followers, and use Josh‚Äôs native features like duets and challenges to boost visibility. Remember, a follower who comments and shares is more valuable than 10k passive views.

### 3. Collaborate with Indian Brands Targeting Regional Markets

In May 2025, brands like Mamaearth, Boat, and Lenskart are actively scouting Josh creators in vernacular markets for influencer marketing campaigns. Reach out to local businesses or use influencer marketing platforms like **BaoLiba** to get matched with relevant brand deals. The focus is on authenticity ‚Äî promote products you genuinely vibe with, or you‚Äôll lose trust fast.

### 4. Experiment with Affiliate Marketing and Live Commerce

Josh supports in-app shopping and affiliate links. Join affiliate programs of Indian e-commerce giants like Flipkart and Amazon India. For creators with a decent following, going live and selling products directly can add serious bucks to your monthly income.

### 5. Get Your Payment Setup Right: INR and Local Wallets Matter

Indian influencers prefer payment via UPI, Google Pay, Paytm, or direct bank transfers in INR. Avoid platforms that pay only in foreign currencies ‚Äî reconverting and withdrawing in INR often eats up your earnings. Brands and agencies now understand this and are streamlining payments accordingly.

### 6. Stay Updated on Legal and Cultural Norms

India has strict guidelines on digital content, especially relating to copyright and advertising disclosures. Always tag sponsored posts with #Ad or #Sponsored as per the Indian IT rules. Also, respect local culture and avoid controversial topics ‚Äî your audience is sensitive, and backlash can kill your growth.

## üìä Example: How Local Creators Are Making 10K+ INR per Month on Josh

Take the case of Priya Sharma from Jaipur, a beauty influencer posting in Hindi and Rajasthani dialects. As of May 2025, she collaborates with local brands like Khadi Natural and Sugar Cosmetics, pulling in around ‚Çπ75,000 (~10K INR) monthly. She combines brand deals, affiliate marketing via Flipkart, and live product demos on Josh.

Another example is tech reviewer Arjun Singh from Lucknow, who specializes in budget smartphones and accessories. He partners with brands like Boat and Mi India, uses affiliate links, and runs contests to keep engagement high. His monthly income via Josh is comfortably above 10K INR.
