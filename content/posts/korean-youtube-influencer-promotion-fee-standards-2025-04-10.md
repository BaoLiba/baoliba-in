## üí∞ 2025 Korean YouTube Cost Per Collaboration Rates

Korean YouTubers will charge you the most for sponsored videos, which should come as no surprise. Sponsored videos are the most effective type of advertisement in influencer marketing. 

According to statistics from a leading Korean influencer marketing agency, a typical Korean YouTuber in 2023 with about 280 thousand subscribers will charge an advertiser around 460,000 KRW to make a sponsored video. This means they charge nearly ‚Çπ30,000 on average to make an ad video showing off a brand‚Äôs products or services.


### 2. Product Reviews

While sponsored videos are the most effective for Korean YouTubers, a product review is also a great option. A product review is a shorter and more casual type of sponsored video, but it‚Äôs likely to yield similar engagement numbers.

On average, a Korean YouTuber will charge an advertiser around 320,000 KRW to make a product review. This means they charge nearly ‚Çπ20,000 on average to authentically give their thoughts on a brand‚Äôs products or services.


### 3. Unboxing Videos

Unboxing videos are the least lucrative type of sponsored video for a Korean influencer. However, they can be very effective. Many viewers have claimed that they cop products from brands after seeing their content in unboxing videos. 

Across their user base, Korean YouTubers will charge advertisers around 270,000 KRW to make an unboxing video. This means they charge nearly ‚Çπ17,500 on average to open a brand's product or service in front of the camera.


### 4. Livestreams

Korean YouTubers can charge a premium for livestreaming collaborations with companies. Livestreaming is very interactive and hard to execute. This means it‚Äôs also the most expensive type of collaboration. 

According to statistics, a typical Korean YouTuber will charge an advertiser nearly 1,500,000 KRW on average to be paid to showcase a brand's products or services live on YouTube. This means they ask for around ‚Çπ98,000 on average for a livestreaming session showcasing a product or service.


### 5. YouTube Short Videos

Korean YouTubers are also creating YouTube short videos as a new way to advertise brands. A YouTube short video is a quick and casual type of video that brands can use to great effect. 

A typical Korean YouTuber will charge an advertiser nearly 350,000 KRW on average to showcase a brand‚Äôs product or service in a YouTube short video. This means they charge around ‚Çπ23,000 on average for a quick social media shoutout.


## üõ°Ô∏è Secure Your Korean YouTube Influencer Deals with Legal Contracts

The Korean influencer marketing industry is relatively well developed, especially compared to other countries. Therefore, there are likely to be many creators that are qualified to partner with brands like yours.

Make sure that before you set your advertising budget that you know how to negotiate with Korean YouTube influencers. But also ensure that once you agree on a price for a promotional collaboration that you secure the deal with a legal contract.

Korean contracts are legal documents that can hold up in a court of law. This means if a Korean YouTuber fails to follow through on their side of a collaboration deal that you can take them to court. 

Likewise, if a Korean influencer negotiates a deal with you but then fails to deliver, you can take them to court as well. No matter the side you are on, working with a qualified legal expert in Korea can ensure that your contract has all the necessary clauses in it.


## üìä More Expensive than Other Markets

According to Plannum's Influencer Marketing Korea Pricing Survey, Korean influencers charge more than those in other Asian markets such as Malaysia and Indonesia. 

Their statistics indicate that a typical Korean influencer will charge around ‚Çπ37,000 for a sponsored post. Meanwhile, a typical Malaysian influencer will charge around ‚Çπ16,000. Indonesian influencers are the cheapest of the three, charging around ‚Çπ10,000 for a sponsored post.

While Korean YouTube influencers charge a little less than your average Korean influencer, they still charge more than typical influencers in other Asian markets.


## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë 2025 Korean YouTubers will have more Subscribers

Korean YouTube influencers are in high demand, both domestically and internationally. If you want to make a reasonable estimate of the pricing for Korean YouTube influencers, you should also factor in the potential for many creators to have more subscribers in the years to come.

According to statistics from Social Blade, an average Korean YouTube influencer has between 200,000 and 300,000 subscribers. By 2025, this number could rise significantly. 

KOREA NETFLIX, a popular channel that focuses on Netflix-related content, has gained nearly a million subscribers since its launch. They just started the channel last December of 2022! If more channels can make this happen, you can rest assured that many Korean YouTube influencers will have millions of subscribers in the next couple years.  

In the end, you can see that it‚Äôs worth spending a little more on influencer marketing when you work with a Korean YouTuber. But you‚Äôll likely need to increase your advertising budget a little bit to make this happen.
