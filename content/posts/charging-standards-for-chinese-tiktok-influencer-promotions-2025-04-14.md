## ðŸ“¢ China is Douyinâ€™s Major Market


Douyin is a Chinese video sharing platform owned by ByteDance. It launched in September 2016 and quickly became an essential part of youth culture.


Douyin is China's version of TikTok. However, the two platforms are entirely separate, and Douyin is not available outside mainland China.


In 2022, Douyin was the largest social media platform in China, with approximately 700 million daily active users. Almost half of Douyin's users are aged 19-39 years old, mostly women, living in first-tier cities like Beijing and Shanghai.


According to statistics, average users spend at least 90 minutes per day on Douyin, and over 40% of Douyin users watch live streams.


Marketing in China can be overwhelming for brands and marketers, especially if they try to navigate Chinese social media without the help of experts. That is because Western platforms like Facebook and Instagram are not available in China. Instead, it is crucial to understand what platforms Chinese consumers actually use.


## ðŸ“¢ Douyinâ€™s Algorithm is More Advanced than TikTok


Despite its similarities to TikTok, Douyin has a plethora of features that set it apart. For example, users are incentivized to make longer videos, and Douyin allows shopping carts, which means users can buy products directly from videos.

According to a Forbes article, Douyin's algorithm is also much more advanced than TikTok's, which is why Douyin has been able to achieve so much more than TikTok in terms of engagement. The number of likes on Douyin videos is much higher than that of TikTok videos.


## ðŸ“¢ Douyin Influencers are Popular on Social Media


Douyin influencers are also popular outside the Douyin app. Many Douyin influencers have millions of followers on platforms like Weibo and Instagram. Thatâ€™s because many Douyin influencers have representative agencies that help them land gigs and promote their work.


Some of Chinaâ€™s most recognizable personalities today are Douyin influencers, who have also become trendsetters and idols for the new generation.


According to BaoLiba, Douyin is the most reliable source of influencer marketing in China. Brands looking for quality influencer marketing campaigns in China can find top tier social media influencers at Douyin. Most are represented by agencies, making them easy to contact and collaborate with lead agencies. 


## ðŸ“¢ Douyin Influencer Pricing is Lower than TikTok


Brands can save a lot of money, up to 50%, by using Douyin influencers instead of TikTok influencers for their campaigns. This is because Douyin influencers tend to have lower fees than their TikTok counterparts. That means influencer marketing budgets for brands should be higher if they are planning to work with TikTok influencers instead of Douyin influencers.
