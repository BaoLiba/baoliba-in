As a top influencer marketing platform, we often see Indian Instagram influencers finding lucrative brand deals in France and other European nations. In 2025, this trend is likely to accelerate.

With most companies, especially luxury brands, dominating the European market, there is a massive demand for Indian Instagram influencers, especially the ones that promote Indian culture or Indian-descended creators.

## ü§≥ The Push Behind Indian Instagram Influencers Working in France

We spoke to multiple European influencer marketing agencies, and they mentioned that Indian culture is having a massive moment in the continent for the past few years. Be it movies, fashion, or food, the masses are gravitating towards it.

Thus, European brands are trying to tap into this opportunity by hiring Indian Instagram influencers who can present their products or services in a way that appeals to an Indian audience living in France or other European nations.

## üí∞ How They Get Hired

Most Indian Instagram influencers have a representative or manager that helps them get brand deals. However, many Instagram influencers have now started to become independent and go direct-to-brand to negotiate contracts.

In this case, direct outreach is the best way to connect with brands. Most Indian Instagram influencers have now started to reach out to brands via Instagram DMs.

If we look closer, we can see that they are also using some influencer marketing platforms that allow them to find such lucrative deals. Some of them are listed below.

## üìä Popular Platforms Indian Instagram Influencers Use To Find Deals In France

### 1. BaoLiba

If we talk about the most popular platform that connects brands to influencers globally, it has to be BaoLiba.

They have a dedicated website for Indian influencers looking for foreign brand deals. Also, they have a dedicated account manager that helps them find deals suitable for their audience.

The thing that stands out about BaoLiba is that they have a dedicated France branch based in Paris. Thus, they have a robust influencer marketing infrastructure in France which is beneficial for Indian Instagram influencers looking to work with French brands.

### 2. Go-Famous

Go-Famous is another popular influencer marketing platform that Indian Instagram influencers are using to connect with brands directly. They have a dedicated page for Indian influencers looking for brand deals in France.

However, it does lack some key features that platforms like BaoLiba have, such as dedicated account managers. Thus, navigating through the platform to find suitable deals can be a bit cumbersome.

### 3. Influence4You

As the name suggests, Influence4You is a French influencer marketing platform. However, they do have a solid base of Indian Instagram influencers that have signed up to work with French brands.

If we talk about the pros, they allow Indian Instagram influencers to find brand deals easily. However, the platform does impose a lot of restrictions, which is why many influencers end up leaving the platform after some time.

### 4. The Shelf

The Shelf is a full-service influencer marketing agency that connects brands with influencers. Many Indian Instagram influencers have signed up to use this platform to land deals with French brands.

What we noticed about this platform is that they have many advertising agencies listed that Indian Instagram influencers can connect with to get their services.

However, if we talk about cons, this platform is limited to only helping influencers in North America. Thus, Indian Instagram influencers can‚Äôt expect to find many French brands looking for their services.

### 5. Indahash

Indahash is another influencer marketing platform that helps Indian Instagram influencers get brand deals in France. It has a decent user interface compared to some of the other platforms we have discussed.

However, it does lack significant features such as guaranteed payment and dedicated account managers. Thus, Indian Instagram influencers need to be cautious while dealing with brands they find on this platform.

## üè¶ How They Get Paid

In France, Indian Instagram influencers get paid mostly in euros. They either use their own accounts to receive payments from brands or use dedicated platforms like Payoneer and PayPal.

However, it is important to note that brands often do not want to deal personally with influencers. Thus, many Indian Instagram influencers hire agencies that take care of payments for them too.

In this case, they get paid in rupees through bank transfers, UPI, or other means. It depends on the Indian Instagram influencer what suits them the best.

## ‚ùó Important Note

If we take a closer look at the popular payment methods, we notice that payments made through online payment platforms like PayPal and Payoneer often attract fees. Thus, influencers lose a portion of their earnings to fees.

Additionally, brands also prefer to avoid paying fees. Thus, they prefer bank transfers. However, bank transfers can take a long time, which can be frustrating for influencers.

To resolve this, influencer marketing platforms like BaoLiba and Go-Famous help Indian Instagram influencers receive their payments instantly. Thus, they avoid losing money to fees and also do not have to wait long to receive their payments.

## üìà The Future

As we stated earlier, the demand for Indian Instagram influencers to promote European brands is at an all-time high. According to a report by Business Wire, the influencer marketing industry will be worth 84.89 billion euros by 2028.

Thus, it is safe to say that Indian Instagram influencers looking for lucrative brand deals in France will soon become the norm as the influencer marketing industry continues to grow rapidly.
