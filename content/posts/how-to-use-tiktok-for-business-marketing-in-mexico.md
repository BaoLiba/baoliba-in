TikTok is a treasure trove for fashion and lifestyle brands and business owners in Mexico. More than 47% of people aged 15 and above use TikTok, and the average user spends more than 45 minutes on the platform. This makes TikTok an ideal marketing platform for brands and businesses that wish to reach the hearts and minds of Mexican consumers. 

For Indian brands, TikTok is a vehicle for growth in Mexico. Given the nature of the platform, influencer marketing is the preferred mode of business advertising on TikTok. Compared to traditional marketing methods, influencer marketing is more affordable and has a higher return on investment (ROI). According to the 2023 Global Influencer Marketing Benchmark Report, marketers earn $5.78 for every dollar spent on influencer marketing.

## How TikTok Influencer Marketing Works in Mexico

Collaborating with influencers on TikTok is a relatively simple process. Brands reach out to influencers whose audience aligns with their target customers and propose a partnership agreement. 

Depending on the agreement, influencers can create a variety of content types showcasing the brand's products or services. This can include unboxings, hauls, tutorials, or testimonials. Since TikTok is a viral platform, brands can reach millions of viewers with just one video. 

Financial compensation is the most common form of payment for influencer marketing collaborations. Indian brands can send money to Mexican influencers via direct bank deposits, PayPal, or even Venmo. 

However, brands can also provide free products or services in exchange for promotional content. Mexican influencers are always looking to build relationships with brands, so this barter agreement can be mutually beneficial.

## Tips for Indian Brands Marketing in Mexico via TikTok 

- **Join TikTok Creator Marketplace**: The TikTok Creator Marketplace connects brands with content creators for influencer marketing collaborations. Signing up ensures that your brand is credible and that you are working with established influencers. 

- **Align Influencers with Your Brand Values**: Ensure that the TikTok influencers you partner with align with your brand values. For instance, if your brand is sustainable, work with eco-friendly influencers. 

- **Be Open-Minded**: TikTok is a bilingual platform, and many Mexican influencers create content in English. You may come across influencers who do not speak Spanish but have a large following in Mexico. Be open about collaborating with them. 

- **Leverage UGC**: User-generated content (UGC) is content created by your customers rather than influencers. Brands should encourage customers to create content showcasing their products and post it on TikTok.  

- **Track Performance**: Use TikTok analytics to track the performance of your videos, hashtag views, and profile views. Monitoring performance can help you gauge how well your brand is doing on the platform and make adjustments if necessary.
