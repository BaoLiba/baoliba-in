- **Brand Type:** Some MThai influencers are very selective about the brands they work with, especially based on the reputation and values of the brand.
- **Exclusivity:** Influencers who agree to work exclusively with a single brand protect that brandâ€™s interests. They tend to charge more than those who allow multiple brands in the same niche to collaborate with them.
