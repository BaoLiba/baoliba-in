While Instagram is the most popular app among Indians, Facebook still comes in second and is the most popular social media platform overall.

This has corporate India clamoring for influencer marketing on the platform, which has long been regarded as the most effective way to sell products and services.

## Facebook is still king among Indian consumers

According to statistics, Facebook is the most popular social media platform in India with over 400 million users.

## Facebook encourages influencer marketing

As competition has intensified from other platforms, Facebook has been making extensive investments to enhance its credibility as a platform for influencer marketing.

In 2021, it established an independent Oversight Board to monitor and provide recommendations on how to create a more authentic platform.

It also launched new features and tools to support creators and businesses.

In 2023, a Facebook spokesperson revealed that the social media giant had an entire team dedicated to assisting brands with influencer marketing.

## How Facebook influencer marketing works in India

Facebook influencer marketing in India works in largely the same way as it does in other markets around the world.

Brands partner with influencers to promote their products on the platform through posts, stories, and live streams, which may include giveaways, demos, and reviews.

The primary difference is that Facebook is still the most popular social media platform overall in India, while it is second or third in most other markets.

This means that Facebook influencer marketing in India is ubiquitous.
