In recent years, several Indian influencers have found a niche market for paid brand deals in Bangladesh. They have established reputations on Facebook and other social media sites, and Bangladeshi brands now pay them to promote their products.

In fact, Bangladeshi brands are now spending about 15% of their marketing budgets on Facebook influencer marketing. They believe Indian influencers can effectively reach the demographic they want to target.



## ðŸ’¡ Bangladeshi brands prefer Facebook influencers

According to a recent report by the New York Times, Bangladeshi marketers rely heavily on Facebook influencers to promote their products and services. Bangladesh has a growing influencer marketing industry, and most brands use Facebook ads to reach their target audience.

They find that people across Bangladesh respond well to influencer marketing on Facebook. In fact, many marketers there have even said that influencer marketing is more effective than Facebook ads.

This is where Indian influencers come in.

Bangladeshi marketers can get better reach and engagement rates with Indian Facebook influencers than with local ones. Also, Indian influencers charge lower fees than Bangladeshi influencers, making them a more attractive option for marketers.



## ðŸ“ˆ Indian influencers charge between â‚¹18,000 and â‚¹30,000 per brand deal

Most Indian influencers who focus on the Bangladeshi market post on Facebook. They usually have 20,000 to 50,000 followers and get at least 1,000 likes on their posts. They charge between â‚¹18,000 and â‚¹30,000 for a single sponsored post.

In Bangladesh, this amount is equivalent to 30,000 to 50,000 takas, which local influencers charge for the same post. This is another reason why Indian influencers are preferred over locals.

Indian influencers also have an edge over Bangladeshi influencers. Many Bangladeshi influencers only write posts in Bengali. But Indian influencers have an English-speaking audience that makes them more desirable.

Most Bangladeshi brands want to reach the youth in urban areas of Bangladesh. English is the main language of the youth in those demographics, so Indian influencers are their best bet.



## ðŸ“¢ Bangladeshi brands looking to reach youth in urban areas

According to Keith Rahman, the head of social at BTL agency Hill and Knowlton, it is crucial for brands wanting to promote their products to the youth to use Facebook influencers.

He believes youth in urban areas are very active on Facebook and follow multiple influencers there. Because Facebook has a significant penetration rate in Bangladesh, it is one of the top platforms for influencer marketing.

For this reason, brands looking to promote their products to youth in Bangladesh must focus on Facebook influencers.

According to Rahman, Indian influencers are more appealing to Bangladeshi brands than local influencers. Most local influencers are Bengali-speaking. They may not resonate as strongly with urban youth who prefer English.

Rahman explained that English is the first language of many urban youth in Bangladesh, making it easier for them to understand and relate to Indian influencers.

Also, Indian influencers can charge lower fees than Bangladeshi influencers for sponsored posts. This is an additional factor that makes them more attractive.


## ðŸ’¡ Indian influencers have better reach and engagement rates than local influencers

Indian influencers in Bangladesh are also known for their unique style. They often emulate the look and feel of popular Indian films. Many Indian influencers have a distinct Bollywood glam that sets them apart from Bangladeshi influencers.

This Bollywood vibe resonates with many urban youth in Bangladesh, making it easier for them to connect with Indian influencers.

In fact, the Indian influence on Bangladeshi pop culture is so overwhelming that many youth idolize Indian actors and actresses. Hence, they relate well with Indian influencers.

Indian influencers have better engagement rates than local influencers. According to a recent study, Indian influencers have an engagement rate of 5.59%, while local influencers have an engagement rate of only 2.87%.

Most Bangladeshi brands look for influencers with a minimum engagement rate of 5%. This is another reason why Indian influencers are preferred over local influencers.


## ðŸ“ˆ Influencer marketing spending to reach â‚¹5.22 trillion by 2025

According to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global influencer marketing industry will reach â‚¹5.22 trillion by 2025. The industry had a value of â‚¹3.69 trillion in 2022. This means the industry will grow by 41% in just three years.

The report also states that social media influencers have become the preferred choice for brands wanting to promote their products. As influence marketing continues to grow, more brands will start relying on social media influencers to reach their target audience.

This is good news for Indian influencers working with Bangladeshi brands. More Bangladeshi brands will allocate larger budgets for influencer marketing. Indian influencers can expect to charge higher fees for brand deals.

According to a report by DazeInfo, India is the top source market for influencers in Bangladesh. Indian influencers account for 40% of all influencers in Bangladesh. 

The report notes that many Indian influencers focus on the Bangladeshi market as it is more lucrative than the Indian market. Indian influencers have better chances of being booked for brand deals in Bangladesh than in India.

This trend is expected to continue, with more Indian influencers discovering the lucrative market in Bangladesh. Bangladeshi brands will also continue to rely on Indian influencers to promote their products and services.
