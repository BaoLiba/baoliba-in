In the vast realm of social media, Twitter has long been India's go-to platform for trending topics, witty banter, and the occasional meme promoting a brand. This makes Twitter influencers a valuable asset in the advertising campaigns of Indian brands. But what happens when these influencers go international, promoting brands in unconventional places like France? 

This is the trend that‚Äôs been picking up momentum since last year, and with the trend predicted to continue into 2025, it‚Äôs time we look at how Indian Twitter influencers collaborate on brand deals with French companies.

## üß≥ The French Connection

As absurd as this may sound, it is very much plausible. With 80 percent of French citizens between the ages of 18 and 24 using Twitter, there is a huge opportunity for brands to connect with younger audiences. This provides Indian Twitter influencers with an opportunity to not only expand their reach but also promote brands from a country that is known for its fashion and flair.

To put things into perspective, a few months ago, Bhavuk Chawla, a well-known Indian Twitter influencer with over 20,000 followers, tweeted a photo of himself donning a classic tuxedo alongside a French caption that read, ‚ÄúThis outfit is from @ChicLuxeFla‚Äù. This tweet attracted over 60 likes and almost 30 retweets, which is quite impressive for a tweet that wasn‚Äôt even in French. 

Looking at Bhavuk‚Äôs account, we see that he has a penchant for exploring foreign fashion choices. His tweets often promote brands from the UK, USA, and even Pakistan! But what really stands out is that his audience primarily consists of locals. This tells us that Bhavuk is building the Indian consumer market for foreign brands.

## üáÆüá≥ From Influencer to Ambassador

So how are Indian Twitter influencers landing brand deals with French companies? Well, just like any other influencer, they have to make the right connections. 

In the case of Bhavuk, this connection came in the form of a management agency that specializes in influencer marketing for French brands. Based in Paris, Chic Luxe Fla helps their clients create buzz and increase their reach in a competitive market by leveraging the power of personality and audience engagement on social media.

The agency lists Bhavuk as one of its ambassadors for India. A quick look at the Chic Luxe Fla website reveals that the agency already has ambassadors in Brazil, Germany, Italy, and Mexico. This goes to show that the brand is serious about breaking into the Indian market.

Not only are agencies facilitating brand deals between Indian Twitter influencers and French companies, but they are also helping them receive payments from abroad. This is no small feat considering France has limited options when it comes to international payments.

## üí∏ Multi-Currency Wallets

Thanks to the digital landscape we live in, global payments are now seamless. But the experience can still be very different depending on where you're situated. While the current methods of payment in France involve cards and traditional bank transfers, they have minimal options for sending cross-border payments. 

This is where multi-currency wallets come in. According to recent data, the global digital wallet market is projected to reach 9.36 trillion dollars by 2025. With audiences straddling both traditional and digital realms, wallets are bridging the gap. They are fast, secure, and are facilitating payments across borders with ease.

With the help of a multi-currency wallet, influencers like Bhavuk can receive payments in French Euros without having to swap currencies and deal with conversion rates. But it‚Äôs not just making payments that is made easier. They can also use these wallets for online shopping and to manage their money. This means that they can send funds to anyone globally, receive payments from anyone, and even swap currencies when necessary ‚Äì all from the comfort of their computer or mobile device.

## üîí Gatekeeping 

While gaining access to overseas brand deals is all fair in love and ads, it‚Äôs worth noting that such opportunities do not come without their risks. Indian Twitter influencers are stepping beyond the comfort of their own turf, but with the lack of regulation that permeates the industry, many influencers are getting scammed by fake agencies. 

Last year, a famous Indian YouTuber named Kiran Dembla of the Warriorr Princess channel revealed in a video that she had been cheated of over ‚Çπ25,000 (around $310) by a fake influencer marketing agency called NORA. NORA pretended to be a brand that was promoting luxury watches. They offered Kiran a deal to create a promotional video and send it to them after she had received payment. After she completed her end of the deal, Kiran never heard from NORA again.

The same pitfalls can befall Indian Twitter influencers looking to connect with international brands. Thus, it is essential to partner with established agencies to mitigate the risk of working with unscrupulous brands. 

## üìÖ Tips to Avoid Scams

Here are a few tips for Twitter influencers to keep in mind when looking to collaborate with foreign brands: 

1. **Ask for a Detailed Brief:**
Always ask for a detailed brief on the deal, including deliverables and payment timelines. 

2. **Use Escrow Services:**
Escrow services are perfect for influencer marketing campaigns as they ensure that the influencer is paid once they‚Äôve met their end of the deal.
 
3. **Secure Contracts:**
Contracts are essential legal documents that outline the specifics of an agreement with a brand. They serve as a binding agreement on the deliverables of both parties, helping to prevent misunderstandings and disputes. 

## üöß Pending Regulations

In India, influencer marketing is largely unregulated. This means that brands can make any claims they want and advertising agencies can work without any oversight. Although the Advertising Standards Authority of India (ASAI) released guidelines in 2021, they have yet to be made a legal requirement. 

French advertising regulations are generally stricter than those of India. This means that Indian Twitter influencers may have to tread carefully so as not to get on the wrong side of the law when promoting French brands. For instance, them spelling out hashtags that contain profanity could be a matter of legal contention. 

## ‚öñÔ∏è The French Law

While influencer marketing emerged in France almost a decade ago, it has only recently come under the purview of French law. Agencies are now required to register with a public registry that requires them to upload contracts with influencers. Brands must now also provide influencers with data analytics regarding their campaign performance. This will ensure that no false claims are made, and influencers can be held accountable if they mislead their audiences. 

In 2025, the French government will introduce a law that requires influencers to declare when they are promoting products with the help of a third-party advertising agency. The law will also require influencers to disclose whether the products being promoted are subject to a beauty standard. In short, Indian Twitter influencers will have to comply with French law when promoting French brands. 

## ü§ù Bringing it All Together

With French brands looking to penetrate the Indian market, they are turning to Indian Twitter influencers as ambassadors to expand their reach in a place that is foreign to them. Though the road ahead may be fraught with hurdles, those who cross them will find that the benefits far outweigh the hardships. 

As Bhavuk would say, ‚ÄúWhen opportunity knocks, do not hesitate and open the door.‚Äù
