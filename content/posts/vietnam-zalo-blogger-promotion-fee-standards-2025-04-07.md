Navigating Vietnam's Zalo influencer pricing can feel as perplexing as deciphering a black market currency conversion. You know it‚Äôs worth money, but how much? 

And that‚Äôs no surprise since Zalo isn't your run-of-the-mill platform. Vietnam's native social media darling ‚Äî owned by VNG Corporation, one of the country's first unicorn tech firms ‚Äî was designed specifically for the Vietnamese market, and it shows. 

Unlike many other Asian markets, Facebook is not the primary source of social media influence in Vietnam. In fact, its usage is falling sharply among the young: only 38% of those aged 18-24 report using Facebook last year, down from 61% the year before.

Instead, according to a study from We Are Social, a full 83% of all Vietnam's 100 million citizens use Zalo, making it both the country's most popular social media app and messaging service, with more than 30 million users daily. 


## üìä Data Insight

That means if you want to market to the Vietnamese consumer, Zalo influencers are key. But gauging how much they charge can be difficult. 

Back in 2021, a Zalo influencer reportedly would charge anywhere from $20 to upwards of $1,000 depending on their reach and engagement. But literally no one has updated that info since! Is that because no influencers want to be locked into a price they may now consider well below their worth? 

Who knows! Either way, hoping that weary sites will eventually update their stats is not an effective marketing strategy. 


## üì¢ Marketing Trends

To gain a sense of what Zalo influencer pricing looks like in 2025, let‚Äôs look at a site that specializes in influencer pricing across a multitude of different platforms:  TechBullion. 

An article titled `Are Zalo Influencers Highly Paid?` cites a Zalo influencer as charging *up to* $1200 for a promotional post, or $300 per image. 

The article further breaks it down, detailing that Zalo influencers with 10,000 followers charge an average of $50, influencers with 50,000 followers charge an average of $152, and influencers with 100,000 followers typically charge $315. 

It‚Äôs worth noting that if you start doing the math, you'll find there's a big disparity between the average rate cited for a Zalo influencer at the top of the article ‚Äî $1200 ‚Äî and the cumulative average rates throughout the piece that totals just over $500. 

But what is clear is that the pricing is competitive with other social media platforms, which is good to know since Zalo is still used by less than 0.1% of the global population.  


## üí° Practical Tips

Another solid source of information for Indian marketers looking to glean Zalo influencer pricing is a site called Vietnam Insider. 

Rather than a hard price, this article gives a good general breakdown of how to gauge what a Zalo influencer may charge. 

- A Zalo influencer with 1,000 to 10,000 followers will charge $30 to $150. 
-  A Zalo influencer with 10,000 to 50,000 followers will charge $150 to $300. 
-  A Zalo influencer with 50,000 to 100,000 followers will charge $300 to $500. 
-  A Zalo influencer with 100,000 to 200,000 followers will charge $500 to $1,000. 
-  A Zalo influencer with 200,000 to 300,000 followers will charge $1,000 to $1,500. 

Additionally, Vietnam Insider emphasizes that Zalo influencers with the most value are those whose influence extends beyond the social media platform. 

These influencers can benefit from their own websites and other social media profiles like Facebook or Instagram, such that they can drive traffic from their other channels to their Zalo account. 

This meta influence adds significant value, making it easier to convert and engage followers who may be new to the influencer via Zalo. 


## ‚ùó Risk Alert

However, of top note is that with such value, you can't be too careful. 

Zalo does offer an advertising platform that you can leverage without needing to work with influencers, but it's important to note that working directly with Zalo might have some restrictions. 

An example of that is when it comes to payment processing. ZaloPay, Zalo's payment processing option for businesses, has certain restrictions for foreign companies wanting to use that payment option. Some companies have tried using ZaloPay to process payments for their services, only to have their accounts shutdown. 

To know what the deal is, it‚Äôs best to work with a local agency that understands all the ins and outs of Zalo influencer marketing. 

One such agency is  Zalo Influencer Marketing, who states on their homepage that they guarantee **10 million impressions**, **1 million interactions**, and **100,000 click-throughs to your Zalo page** in just **30 days**, or your money back. 

They also claim to know **exactly** how much Zalo influencers charge or else they can get them for free! 


## üí∞ Payment Methods

While it‚Äôs always good to be wary of the **exact** promises made by agencies, one great thing about Zalo Influencer Marketing is that they list their prices right there on the homepage:  

- **$250-500** for 1 influencer. 
- **$750-1,500** for 3 influencers. 
- **$1,500-3,000** for 5 influencers. 
- **$2,500-5,000** for 10 influencers. 

Now, as stated earlier, Zalo advertising may be difficult for Indian brands to leverage directly, but Zalo Influencer Marketing can handle that for you. 

For the Zalo advertisement itself, the agency points out that ZaloPay works best for local brands, whereas international brands can simply  use Paypal or bank transfer.
