Many Indian influencers on Twitter are now establishing their presence in Singapore. They are making an international name for themselves through brand deals in the Southeast Asian city.

But how do Indian Twitter influencers find brand deals in Singapore? What methods do they employ to crack big deals?

Let‚Äôs uncover the strategies that Indian Twitter influencers are using to bag brand deals in Singapore.

## ü§ù Finding Brands and Getting Noticed

Indian influencers on Twitter are using the platform‚Äôs user base in Singapore to attract brands for advertising deals. With Twitter being popular among Singaporeans, Indian influencers can get noticed and hired by brands.

Indian influencers are also leveraging their networks to find brands looking for advertising services on Twitter. They are reaching out to friends, colleagues, and acquaintances in their circles who have ties to Singapore and asking them for leads.

Some Indian influencers are also using influencer marketing platforms to find brands. These platforms connect influencers with brands looking for advertising services.

Despite brand deals being scarce on Twitter, many Indian influencers are making significant advertising income on the platform. They are reaching out to local brands in Singapore directly to offer their services for advertising.

One Twitter influencer named Vikas Bagri has garnered a lot of attention in Singapore. He posted a tweet saying that it was cool for a local Singaporean brand to work with him for publicity.

The tweet also included a photo of Bagri holding a bottle of Milo. Milo is a popular chocolate malt beverage brand owned by Nestl√©.

Bagri also shared that he was having a cup of Milo in another tweet. He said that Milo was his favorite drink and that he usually drank it before studying.

It is not clear how Bagri got the deal to promote Milo, but it is evident that he has made a significant impact in Singapore.

Another Indian influencer named Vishal Muddanna shared that he had received a direct message from a local brand in Singapore for a brand deal. The message invited Muddanna to promote their brand for an undisclosed payment, which was a very good offer.

Muddanna said that he had previously contacted them for a brand deal, but they said they did not work with Indian influencers. After some time, the brand contacted Muddanna and opened up about working with him.

Muddanna said that Singaporean brands were very picky and that he had been rejected by many brands. He advised Indian Twitter influencers seeking brand deals in Singapore to keep going, and they would likely succeed.

## üåè Twitter Popularity in Singapore

Indian influencers on Twitter are tapping into the platform's popularity in Singapore to gain their attention. They understand that many Singaporeans are active Twitter users, which provides a conducive environment for advertising.

Over 30% of Singaporeans are actively using Twitter, making it one of the most popular social media platforms in the city. This popularity is driving many brands to invest more in advertising on Twitter.

Another reason why Singapore is a prime market for Indian Twitter influencers is that it ranks among the top countries with the highest number of Twitter users.

## üí∞ High Income Potential

Indian influencers on Twitter can earn substantial income from brand deals, with some making as much as ‚Çπ50,000-‚Çπ1,00,000 per tweet. This large income potential is another reason why many Indian influencers are targeting Singapore for brand deals.

If an Indian Twitter influencer is able to bag two brand deals every week, they can earn up to ‚Çπ8,00,000 per month or ‚Çπ96,00,000 per year. This is a substantial income that many influencers are willing to pursue.

## üîç Search Intent in Twitter Hashtags

Many Indian influencers are using Twitter hashtags to find brands and attract them. They have discovered that brands are searching for influencers on Twitter using specific hashtags.

Some hashtags that Indian influencers are using include #BrandAmbassador, #BrandDeal, #BrandPartnership, and #BrandCollab. They are also using hashtags that are specific to their niche.

These hashtags indicate that influencers are seeking brands for deals. This is a signal for brands to reach out to influencers for advertising.

Brands are also using these hashtags to find influencers for deals. Some are posting tweets using these hashtags to attract influencers.

Many brands are taking notice of Indian influencers using these hashtags. They are reaching out to them for brand deals.

## üì± Embracing Twitter

Some Indian influencers are living in Singapore and have embraced Twitter as their primary social media platform. They have a large presence on the platform and are often referred to as Twitter influencers.

Twitter influencers have emphasized that they are not conventional social media influencers. They do not produce and share visual content like videos and photos. Instead, they produce and share written content in the form of tweets.

They have built a strong following on Twitter and are now a go-to source for brands looking for advertising services on the platform.

One Twitter influencer named Aryan tweeted that he had moved to Singapore. He said that he wanted to establish himself there and be recognized as a leading Twitter influencer.

Another Indian Twitter influencer named Samrat Kumar said that he was in Singapore for a business trip. He also emphasized that he was a Twitter influencer and not a regular influencer like on Instagram.

## üìà Brands Reaching Out

Many Indian Twitter influencers have also reported that they have been contacted directly by brands for advertising. Brands have noticed their influence on the platform and have invited them to promote their products and services.

One Twitter influencer named Aditya shared that a brand had sent him a direct message for a brand deal. The message invited Aditya to promote their brand and included all the necessary details.

Another Twitter influencer named Vivek Kumar claimed that three brands had contacted him for brand deals. He posted inquiring about the legitimacy of the offers and whether they were genuine brand deals.

## üß≥ International Payments

Many Indian Twitter influencers have raised concerns about payments when dealing with Singapore brands. They have discovered that many brands in Singapore prefer to pay influencers through Payoneer, which is an overseas payment service.

This is a cause for concern for some influencers because they are not familiar with Payoneer. They are accustomed to using more conventional payment services like PayPal for brand deals.

Many Indian Twitter influencers have emphasized that Payoneer is a secure and reliable payment solution for international payments. They have encouraged other influencers who are skeptical about using Payoneer to embrace it for overseas brand deals.

## üëÄ Scams to Look Out For

While many Indian Twitter influencers have successfully acquired brand deals in Singapore, others have been scammed. Scams targeting influencers are not new, and many influencers have reported falling victim to them.

One Twitter influencer shared that he had fallen victim to a scam while pursuing a brand deal in Singapore. He said that the scammers made it look like the deal was genuine, but it turned out to be a scam.

He revealed that the scammers had asked him to buy a few items for their brand. After he bought the items and shared proof with the scammers, they ghosted him.

Another Twitter influencer named Rajesh claimed that he was scammed while pursuing a brand deal in Singapore. He said that he was promised a payment of $1,500, but he never received the payment after doing what he was asked to do.

Many Indian Twitter influencers seeking brand deals in Singapore have been warned not to send money to brands. They have been reminded that genuine brands will never ask influencers to send money upfront for a deal.
