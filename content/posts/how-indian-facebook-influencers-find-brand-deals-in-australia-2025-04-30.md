Indian influencers are venturing into the Australian market and using Facebook to do it. 

With the Australian advertising industry surging to a staggering worth of about 23.2 billion Australian dollars in 2025, Indian influencers see an opportunity to earn big in Australia.


In a bid to infiltrate the Australian influencer market, Indian influencers are leveraging Facebook to promote their services to Australian brands.

## üá¶üá∫ Endless Opportunities in Australia

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, nearly three million Australians used social media to share or promote content in 2021. 

Moreover, as of January 2023, Australia has over 21 million social media users, representing a staggering 82.5% of the total population. 

Of these users, approximately 23% are between 25 and 34 years old, making this age group the largest segment of social media users in Australia.

Social media users in Australia are expected to increase to 27 million by 2026, creating an endless supply of opportunities for the influencer marketing industry. 

In fact, eMarketer estimates that spending on influencer marketing in Australia will reach $2.3 billion by 2026, nearly doubling the total spent in 2023.

With the Australian advertising industry expected to maintain a steady growth rate, more businesses are likely to adopt influencer marketing strategies.

This means that Indian influencers stand to earn big by tapping into the Australian influencer market.

## üì± Facebook: The Preferred Platform for Indian Influencers

Facebook is the preferred platform for Indian influencers seeking brand deals in Australia. 

While it may seem outdated in the West, Indian influencers are finding a wealth of opportunities on Facebook. 

In India, Facebook is still widely used as a digital marketplace. 

This means that influencers can not only showcase their portfolios and advertising rates but also connect with brands directly to secure brand deals online.

For instance, one Indian influencer, who wished to remain anonymous, stated that she began marketing herself on Facebook after noticing how many Australian brands sought her services through the platform.

‚ÄúI initially thought it was strange that so many Australian brands approached me on Facebook. In India, Facebook is not as popular among brands as Instagram and YouTube, but it seems that many Australian brands are still using Facebook to search for influencers. After doing my research, I realized that many Indian influencers are finding brand deals in Australia using Facebook. So, I decided to do the same,‚Äù she said.

Facebook has a plethora of influencer marketing groups filled with brands looking for influencers in Australia and Indian influencers are taking full advantage of this.

Some of the groups include ‚ÄúAustralian Bloggers and Influencers‚Äù, ‚ÄúAustralian Fashion & Lifestyle Bloggers & Influencers‚Äù, ‚ÄúAussie Influencers‚Äù, and many more. 

In these groups, brands often post requests for influencers to work with, and Indian influencers can simply respond to these requests to start negotiating a brand deal.

## üõçÔ∏è Indian Influencers Have a Competitive Edge

Indian influencers have a competitive edge over their Australian counterparts. 

This is because many Indian influencers charge significantly less than Australian influencers. 

For instance, Australian influencer Jessica Lickiss, with over 7 million followers on TikTok, charges brands $3,700 for a sponsored post on TikTok.

In comparison, Indian influencer Pooja Jain charges brands approximately $250 for a sponsored post on Instagram, which has 1 million followers.

Therefore, Australian brands can save a considerable amount of money by hiring Indian influencers instead.

This explains why over 500 Indian influencers have secured brand deals in Australia in 2023 alone.

Many Indian influencers have also reported that their current rates are still negotiable even if they are less than Australian influencers. 

This makes them even more attractive to Australian brands looking to save on advertising costs.

## üíµ Payment Methods for Indian Influencers Working with Australian Brands

In order to receive payments from Australian brands, Indian influencers often use international payment platforms such as PayPal, TransferWise, and Payoneer.

According to many Indian influencers, PayPal is the most widely accepted payment method among Australian brands. 

This is because more Australian brands already have a PayPal business account and they usually prefer to use this account to pay for influencer services. 

‚ÄúSince most Australian brands already have a PayPal account, they usually ask me if I can receive payments through PayPal. I always say yes because it is also the easiest method for me,‚Äù said one Indian influencer from Mumbai.

As for fees, PayPal charges a fee of 4.99% plus a fixed fee based on the currency received for personal payments made through the PayPal account balance. 

This means that Indian influencers would incur a fee of approximately 15.58 Indian rupees for receiving a payment of 3120 Indian rupees ($38.18) from Australia.

In contrast, TransferWise and Payoneer charge a fee of 1.5% and 1% respectively. 

This means that Indian influencers would incur a fee of approximately 46.89 Indian rupees and 31.20 Indian rupees for receiving a payment of 3120 Indian rupees from Australia. 

## üáÆüá≥ Indian Laws Regarding Foreign Payments

As stated in Chapter II, Section 6 of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) of 1999, Indian residents can receive payments for services rendered to foreign clients or companies. 

So, Indian influencers who secure brand deals with Australian brands can legally receive payments for their services. 

However, the amount received cannot exceed the amount of 1 million Indian rupees in one financial year, unless prior permission is obtained from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). 

In addition, Indian influencers are not allowed to receive payments directly from foreign clients. 

They must have a bank account with an authorized dealer to receive foreign payments for their services. 

Authorized dealers are usually banks or financial institutions that are authorized to deal in foreign exchange.

When receiving payments from brands in Australia, Indian influencers usually give them their bank account details to deposit payments into their account. 

However, brands in Australia cannot send payments directly to Indian influencers‚Äô accounts. 

Instead, they would send money to the Indian influencers‚Äô authorized dealers, and the dealers would then credit the amounts received to the Indian influencers‚Äô accounts. 

In this case, PayPal, TransferWise, or Payoneer also act as authorized dealers. 

For this reason, Indian influencers can safely use these platforms to receive payments for their services from Australian brands.

## üíª Work With a Professional to Cut Out the Middleman

Although Indian influencers can use Facebook to find brand deals in Australia, they can still enlist the help of a professional to cut out the middleman.

According to many Indian influencers, some Australian brands charge them a fee of 15-30% of the total payment. 

This is because these brands must work with Australian influencer marketing agencies that charge them this fee. 

Then, the brands also charge Indian influencers this fee for hiring them.

For instance, if an Australian brand pays 1000 AUD for an Indian influencer to post about them, the brand might deduct 300 AUD from this amount as an agency fee and give the Indian influencer 700 AUD instead.

If the Indian influencer paid at least 100 AUD to work with an influencer marketing agency in India, they would end up with about 600 AUD. 

This means that the Australian brand and both agencies would end up with a significant amount of money, while the Indian influencer would earn much less.

To avoid this scenario, Indian influencers can work with a professional who has connections with many Australian brands looking for influencers. 

The professional can help the Indian influencer secure brand deals without charging them a hefty fee. 

Instead, they can charge a small and reasonable percentage of the total payment, allowing Indian influencers to earn more.

## üåè The Future of Indian Influencers in Australia is Bright

The future of Indian influencers seeking brand deals in Australia is bright. 

As the Australian advertising industry continues to grow, more Indian influencers are likely to tap into this lucrative market. 

And with Facebook being the preferred platform for Indian influencers looking for brand deals in Australia, it is safe to say that this trend is here to stay.
