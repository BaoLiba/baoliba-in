The rise of influencer marketing has opened doors for a wide range of content creators to work with brands across various platforms. ShareChat is one such platform that is gaining traction among influencers in India. The app is particularly popular among influencers who specialize in regional content.

As Indian influencers on ShareChat grow in prominence, they are exploring new territories, including Malaysia. Malaysian brands are keen to collaborate with Indian influencers on ShareChat to appeal to Indians living in Malaysia, and Indian influencers are leveraging this to expand their portfolios.

We spoke to several influencers from ShareChat to find out how they are connecting with Malaysian brands for influencer marketing campaigns.

## üìñ Who Are ShareChat Influencers?

ShareChat is a social media platform based in India that has gained popularity among regional creators. The platform allows users to create and share content in 15 languages. Launched in 2015, ShareChat now boasts over 180 million monthly active users. The app has garnered praise for its efforts to promote local content. 

ShareChat influencers can be defined as users who have a significant following on the ShareChat platform and are dedicated to producing content regularly. Just like influencers on other platforms, ShareChat influencers use their following to promote brands and products to earn money.

Engaging with ShareChat influencers is equally important for brands looking to reach Indian audiences across the globe, including Malaysia. 


## üì¢ Why Malaysian Brands Want to Collaborate with ShareChat Influencers

ShareChat influencers hold a unique appeal for Malaysian brands. According to the 2021 census, there are nearly 2 million Indians living in Malaysia. 

While many Malaysian brands are focused on tapping into the Malaysian audience, Indian influencers on ShareChat can help them target Indian audiences in Malaysia. These influencers have an established rapport with Indian audiences through their online content, giving them the credibility to promote brands to this audience.

For Malaysian brands that want to target Indian audiences, collaborating with ShareChat influencers is a viable strategy. 

## üìñ How Malaysian Brands Connect with Indian ShareChat Influencers

The primary way Malaysian brands are connecting with Indian ShareChat influencers is through influencer marketing agencies. These agencies help brands identify the right influencers for their campaigns and manage the entire process. 

We spoke to Sasi, founder of NRI Digital Marketing, an influencer marketing agency based in Tamil Nadu. Sasi revealed that his agency represents Tamil influencers from ShareChat who have been contacted by Malaysian brands looking to target Indian audiences in Malaysia.

Sasi explained how these collaborations usually go. 

‚ÄúMost of our influencers already had a good following on ShareChat. They have been working with local brands in Tamil Nadu and other parts of India. When we received inquiries from Malaysian brands looking to collaborate with Indian influencers, we reached out to our influencers to ask if they were interested. They were eager to take on these collaborations since they could charge more than what they usually charge for a campaign. We already had the experience of managing campaigns with local brands in India, so we could easily replicate the same model for Malaysian brands.‚Äù

## üì¢ How ShareChat Influencers Charge Malaysian Brands for Campaigns

The fees charged by ShareChat influencers for campaigns with Malaysian brands vary widely. 

Sasi told us that influencers with a larger following can charge anywhere from 10,000 to 50,000 Indian Rupees for a post on ShareChat. This is significantly more than what they usually charge for campaigns with Indian brands. 

Sasi provided a breakdown of the fees charged by influencers according to their follower range.

- **10,000 to 50,000 followers:** ‚Çπ10,000 to ‚Çπ20,000
- **50,000 to 100,000 followers:** ‚Çπ25,000 to ‚Çπ35,000
- **100,000 and above followers:** ‚Çπ40,000 to ‚Çπ50,000

These amounts are equivalent to around RM550 to RM2,750. The fees are higher for Malaysian brands because they usually require payment in US dollars. 

## üìñ Payment Methods Used by ShareChat Influencers to Accept Fees from Malaysian Brands

While Malaysian brands prefer to pay in US dollars, they often find it difficult to send money directly to India. This is why many brands opt to go through influencer marketing agencies like NRI Digital Marketing. 

According to Sasi, Malaysian brands usually send payment for their campaigns through money transfer services such as PayPal, Wise, Ria Money Transfer, or Western Union. 

‚ÄúMost Malaysian brands will ask us to provide our PayPal account to make the payment. Once they send the payment to our PayPal account, we will take our commission and forward the rest to the influencer‚Äôs bank account. If they want to use other money transfer services, we will accommodate that as well,‚Äù said Sasi.

Influencers usually charge a commission of 15% to 20% for such services. 

## üì¢ Tips for Indian ShareChat Influencers to Find Brand Deals in Malaysia

If you are interested in marketing your content creation services to Malaysian brands, here are some tips to get you started.

### Use Regional Hashtags

Instead of using hashtags that target Indian audiences in general, use hashtags that specifically target Indian audiences in Malaysia. For example, you can use hashtags like #ChennaiMalaysia to connect with Malaysians from Chennai. 

### Reach Out to Influencer Marketing Agencies

Influencer marketing agencies that specialize in connecting influencers with brands are a great resource for finding influencer marketing opportunities. One of the best ways to find such agencies is by searching for hashtags related to influencer marketing on Instagram.

### Be Open to Working with Agencies

While many brands prefer to work directly with influencers, there are those that would rather work with agencies. Being open to working with agencies can open doors for you to land more deals. 

## üìñ Conclusion

Influencers on ShareChat are finding lucrative brand partnerships with Malaysian brands looking to connect with Indian audiences in Malaysia. Many of these influencers are already established creators in India, so they offer a unique opportunity for local brands to expand their reach beyond their borders.

It is likely that this trend will continue as Malaysian brands begin to see the benefits of collaborating with ShareChat influencers.
