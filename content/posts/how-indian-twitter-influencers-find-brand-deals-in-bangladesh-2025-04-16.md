The Bangladesh marketing world is discovering that Indian Twitter influences are more effective than local Bangladeshi influencers. Hence, they are enlisting the services of Indian Twitter influencers to land brand deals across the border. 


## üé≠ Bangladesh Brands Searching for Indian Twitter Influencers


It all started when tweet from the Indian actor, comedian, and producer, Sunil Pal, went viral among Bangladeshis. 


In the tweet, Sunil Pal made a bold statement that he is the biggest fan of Bangladeshi superstar Shakib Khan. Along with this heartfelt confession he also tagged various Bangladeshi brand names. 


The Bangladeshi brands, amazed by the outpouring of love from the Indian actor towards Shakib Khan, jumped on the opportunity and started engaging to Sunil Pal. 


For example, the tweet from Sunil Pal was seen by Teer, a popular Bangladeshi cement brand. They expressed their admiration for Sunil Pal and then stated how they also admire Shakib Khan. 


The Teer Brand Manager then tweeted to Sunil Pal asking him to reach out privately. Though the public does not know what happened in the private conversation, it appears there was some form of collaboration agreed upon between the parties. 


The next day Teer confirmed that Sunil Pal is the official brand ambassador for Teer Cement. 


Bangladeshi brands have now discovered that they should not ignore tweets from Indian influencers. Hence, from now on they will be searching for Indian influencers on Twitter who are fan of their brand and products. 


## üì∫ Bangladesh Influencers not Enough

It is likely that the experiences that the Bangladeshi brands have had with local Twitter influences has led them to turn their minds to Indian Twitter influencers. 


That is because they find that local influencers dupe them. 


A notable example is when a Bangladesh brand was duped by a Bangladeshi influencer named Gummy. 


The influencer and presumably her management team, falsely claimed that she had a huge social media following. 


It was reported widely by local news outlets that Gummy would charge brands and businesses up to BDT 20,000 (around USD 180) for a social media post on her behalf. 


However, the influencer had a mere 1,000 followers on her Facebook page, 100 subscribers on YouTube and a pathetic 30 followers on Twitter. 


When confronted by the media Gummy admitted that she had faked her social media following and had duped brands and businesses in Bangladesh. 


This case has hurt the credibility of Bangladeshi influencer as a category. As a result, Bangladeshi brands have been canvasing for Indian Twitter influencers as a better alternative.


## üíµ Payment Platforms

Bangladesh brands wanting to partner with Indian Twitter influencers face a formidable challenge: payments. 


Many Bangladesh brands have found the workaround to make payments by using the services of a money transfer app named SendFriend. 


SendFriend is known in the industry for its fee-less service, and it occupies a prime space among such services as Western Union and PayPal. 


The platform allows people to send money to each other, or merchants can receive payments for the products and services that they sell. 


Bangladeshi brands wishing to partner with Indian Twitter influencers can use SendFriend to send payments to a cellphone number, email address, or bank account belonging to the Indian Twitter influencer. 


This allows the influencer to then convert the payment into his own currency from Bangladeshi Taka to Indian Rupees. 


For example, if a Bangladeshi brand pays Indian Twitter influencer USD 100, he can then choose to receive that money as BDT 10,000, or INR 8,800. 


## üìä Bangladeshi Consumers Love Indian Movies

It is also important to note just how much Indians and Bangladeshi consumers love their respective films. 


Indian movies are more popular than local Bangladeshi films. Many people in the country have claimed that mainstream Bangladeshi films have lost their charm and appeal. 


In fact, the Bangladeshi film industry is experiencing a crisis due to the lack of attention from local audiences. Many filmmakers feel that they should indeed focus more on making films that feature Indian superstars.


## üé¨ Indian Movies Released in Bangladesh

Bollywood films regularly get released in cinemas across the border. 


And it is not just A-list films from big production houses. 


Even small Bollywood films are released in Bangladesh. 


This has led many filmmakers to explore the prospects of making small and medium budget films that cast popular Indian actors and actresses. 


This is the magic of cinema. 


And this is also why Bangladeshi brand managers are looking for Indian Twitter influencers. 


They know that their consumers, who are obsessed with Indian cinema, will also take the word of an Indian Twitter influencer over local influencer. 


Therefore, it is only natural brands want to align with the Bollywood star.


## üíÅüèΩ Twitter Influencer Marketing Tips

Bangladeshi brands wanting to attract Indian Twitter influencers can follow these Twitter influencer marketing tips. 


First they can ditch old PR strategies and replace them with a strategy that looks like a salesperson template. 


Instead of sending plain proposal emails, they can present offers in a creative manner. Copywriting platforms such as Canva can help brands design beautiful media and graphics to get the attention of Twitter influencers.


They can also offer a free plan that lets the influencer try out their product. 


Offering free products to influencers is also a good way to get them on board. 


Brands should also follow the influencer on Twitter. 


They should also engage with their posts. 


Brands should try to ensure that the influencers notice them. 


This way they will have a greater chance of impressing them and getting them to take a look at the proposal email that brands sent earlier.


Finally, they should state on their official website or social media pages that they are open to collaborations. 


They should also clarify that they are willing to collaborate with Indian Twitter influencers. 


This way they will attract Indian Twitter influencers looking for brands that are open to collaboration. 

 
## üö®  Conclusion

That bangladeshi brands are now looking for Indian Twitter influencers to promote their products and services shows just how influential and effective the Indian Twitter influencer category can be. 


Hence in 2025, expect Bangladeshi brands to intensify their search for Indian Twitter influencers to market them. 


This trend is likely to continue as long as Bangladeshi brands realize that they need Indian Twitter influencers to promote them across the border.
