As the world is opening itself to the power of influencer marketing to increase brand awareness, the need for authenticity in influencer partnerships has never been greater. 

Unfortunately, the Chinese influencer space continues to be riddled with fake followers, fraudulent engagement, and untrustworthy reviews, which put international brands at risk of tarnishing their reputations if they partner with the wrong influencer.

Thus if you want to optimize your next influencer marketing strategy, you should avoid partnering with Chinese influencers and instead hire trustworthy natives to promote your brand. 


### The Problem With Chinese Influencers

Influencers from China have become notorious for their high rate of fraud when it comes to their follower counts. According to a report by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, over 98% of influencers on Chinese platforms have inflated their follower counts.

The Chinese influencer industry continues to be plagued by fake followers and fake engagement as it becomes increasingly popular and valuable. 

Unlike the West, where social media platforms are heavily monitored and regulated to prevent bots and fraudulent accounts from growing, the same cannot be said for Chinese platforms, which allows their influencer space to thrive on deception.


### Chinese Platforms Are Infested With Bots

It is difficult to track down just how many influencers have fake followers in China due to the lack of infrastructure in place to regulate their social media platforms. Thus, the real number of inflated follower counts could be significantly higher than 98%.

However, the report by the Chinese Academy of Sciences does show that 99% of celebrities with over a million followers have inflated their numbers. 

The Chinese platforms that many influencers use including Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok), Xiaohongshu, and Kuaishou thrive in an environment free from any significant regulation on user authenticity.

The lack of regulation has led to the Chinese influencer ecosystem growing larger than their Western counterparts, but the lack of authenticity makes it that much more dangerous when it comes to influencer marketing.

Many international brands rely on the follower count of influencers as a benchmark for their popularity in order to choose who to partner with. 

But because of the high levels of fraud in China, brands that choose the wrong influencer can not only waste their marketing budgets but also damage their reputation due to their lack of authenticity. 


### Independent Studies Validate Fraud Levels

While the report from the Chinese Academy of Sciences is alarming in itself, independent studies also validate the high levels of fraud among Chinese influencers. 

According to a separate study by Hootsuite, 62% of Chinese influencers use bots to inflate their followers and 46% use bots to inflate their engagement.

The same study showed that 75% of Chinese influencers believe that bots help them gain access to more sponsorship opportunities, which indicates that they are willing to sacrifice their authenticity for profit.

The willingness of influencers to engage in fraudulent practices is a red flag for any brand looking to partner with them, especially if they are from another country and have no way of verifying their claims.


### Brands Canâ€™t Trust Chinese Influencers

The lack of authenticity is not only a problem for brands looking to partner with influencers, but it is also a problem for the influencers themselves. 

According to 8.5% of influencers surveyed by Hootsuite, they experience more than 70% of their engagement being fake. This indicates that while many influencers are inflating their follower counts, they are also subject to the same fraudulent practices by others.

And unfortunately for influencers, brands are becoming increasingly aware of the fraud levels and are wary when it comes to influencer partnerships.

According to the report by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 54% of brands do not trust influencers anymore. This is a significant drop from the 79% of brands that trusted influencers in 2020, and it indicates that the influencer marketing bubble in China is beginning to burst.

The high level of fraud is likely the main cause of the lack of trust from brands, and it will only get worse as more brands realize how much they have been deceived by Chinese influencers. 


### The East Is Not Like The West

The regulatory environment of Western social media platforms makes them much more difficult to manipulate, which is why they have a much lower rate of fraud when it comes to their influencers.

Even still, brands are becoming more cautious of working with influencers in general due to the rising levels of fraud in the West as well.

Thus, all brands need to be careful when scouting influencers, especially when it comes to foreign influencers from China.

However, many foreign brands are still having success in China by using local influencers to promote their products. 

The difference is that they are using trustworthy influencers instead of Chinese influencers who take shortcuts and sabotage their reputation when they fail to deliver on their promises.


### How To Avoid Chinese Influencer Pitfalls

You can easily avoid the pitfalls that come with partnering with Chinese influencers by sourcing trustworthy influencers through agencies that specialize in Chinese influencer marketing.

Agencies that focus on influencer marketing in China will have the experience and knowledge of the industry that is needed to find influencers that have authentic followings and engagement.

This will help you to partner with influencers who are truly popular and who can deliver real results for your brand. 

The world of influencer marketing is only going to get bigger and bigger, and brands that can navigate the landscape properly will be the ones to come out on top. 

Chinese influencers may be popular, but their lack of authenticity makes them a liability for foreign brands looking to make a name for themselves in China. 


### Hire Indian Influencers For Your Next Campaign Instead

If you do wish to avoid the risks that come with hiring Chinese influencers, one of the best alternatives is to hire Indian influencers.

India has a burgeoning influencer marketing ecosystem that can rival China, but unlike China, the influencer marketing landscape in India is much more authentic and trustworthy. 

According to the Influencer Marketing Hub, India has 87 million Instagram influencers, making them the largest influencer market globally.

Hiring Indian influencers to promote your brand will provide you with all the advantages that a trustworthy influencer can bring to your marketing strategy while avoiding the pitfalls that come with hiring Chinese influencers.

You will be able to expand your brand awareness in the competitive Indian market while avoiding the fraud and lack of authenticity that comes with hiring influencers from China.
