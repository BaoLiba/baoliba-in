Despite the geographical proximity to China and India, Nepal has remained largely untouched by the influencer marketing tsunami that has made waves in the global marketing industry, until recently. 

The emergence of Nepal as a prime market for Indian LinkedIn influencers is evidenced by the growing number of brand deals that Indian influencers are signing with Nepali brands.

From Nepali travel agencies to Nepali fashion brands, Indian LinkedIn influencers are making the most of the abundant brand deals available in Nepal, while also being able to dodge the expensive influencer marketing rates that are a normal part of India.

As the demand for Indian LinkedIn influencers in Nepal is set to grow in 2025, now is the time to discover how Indian influencers in Nepal are navigating the budding influencer market.

## üèîÔ∏è Why Nepal is the Go-To Market for Indian LinkedIn Influencers

Nepal has emerged as the prime market for Indian LinkedIn influencers for a multitude of reasons. 

For one, Nepal has many brands that want to grow their audiences, especially on the professional social media platform LinkedIn. 

Yet, they have limited budgets that do not allow them to hire the more established Indian LinkedIn influencers who are already swamped by Indian brands. 

This has led to a booming B2B influencer marketing sector in Nepal, where many of the budding Nepali brands are collaborating with Indian influencers. 

For Indian influencers, they can take advantage of the lower rates that they charge to Nepali brands, while also exploring the lucrative market that is Nepal. 

## üèóÔ∏è Discovering the Brand Deals in Nepal

The search for Nepali brands to collaborate with is a straightforward process for Indian LinkedIn influencers. 

Some of them have used search keywords like ‚ÄúNepal,‚Äù or ‚ÄúNepal brand,‚Äù in the LinkedIn search bar to discover brands that have already made their presence felt on LinkedIn. 

In doing so, they are able to find not only Nepali brands, but also other Nepali LinkedIn influencers who share a similar audience. 

By doing this, Indian influencers can find a suitable Nepali LinkedIn influencer to collaborate with so that they can leverage each other's audiences. 

## üß≥ Examples of Influencer Brands Deals in Nepal 

Some of the Indian LinkedIn influencers who have already collaborated with Nepali brands include:

**Sanjay Shukla** - A Business & HR Consultant and LinkedIn influencer with over 600K followers, Sanjay has collaborated with the Nepali brand Synergy Recruitment & Consultancy.

The deal saw Sanjay post about Synergy Recruitment, while also creating a detailed video about the brand on his YouTube channel. 

**Gaurav Bhatia** - A Digital Marketing Consultant and LinkedIn influencer with over 120K followers, Gaurav has collaborated with KTH Nepal, a Nepali travel agency.

The deal saw him not only post about KTH Nepal on his LinkedIn, but he also shared his thoughts about the company on his YouTube channel.

## üìà Growing Demand for Indian LinkedIn Influencers in Nepal 

The demand for Indian LinkedIn influencers in Nepal is set to grow even larger in 2025. 

With the Nepali travel agency KTH Nepal having hired two Indian LinkedIn influencers, expect to see many more Nepali brands follow suit. 

In the early months of 2023, the social media marketing expert, and influencer, Ashish Jain, has signed a Nepali brand deal with KTH Nepal.
