The Indian influencer scene is booming, especially on Instagram. Influencers have become an essential component of marketing both in India and around the world. An Indian influencer might even be the last person you‚Äôd expect to find in Australia working on behalf of Indian brands.


These influential personalities are not only changing the marketing landscape at home, but they are also bridging the gap between Australia and India in unexpected ways.


In this post, we‚Äôll explore the unexpected ways in which Indian influencers work with brands in Australia to promote Indian products.

## üì∏ Many Indian Influencers Live in Australia


India has a thriving diaspora in Australia. According to the latest Census, 660,000 Australians are of Indian descent, and among them, more than 25% were born in India.


Australia has become the third most popular destination for Indian students who are drawn to the country's reputation of having the best educational facilities and excellent opportunities for employment and career advancement.


Indian students constitute the second largest group of foreign students in Australia's higher education enrolments.


Australia is also one of India's most valuable partners in terms of trade. In the last decade alone, India has emerged as Australia's second largest export market for education, third largest services market, and fourth largest export market for agricultural products.


With increased interactions between the two countries, many Indians travel to Australia on business. Many of them stay for good and some of them return to India after spending years in Australia.


For instance, when it comes to studying in Australia, only five percent of Indian students who are graduates of Australian universities return to India. The majority of them use their Australian qualifications and work experience to obtain permanent residency in Australia.

This ongoing trend has resulted in thousands of Indian students, businessmen, and professionals living in Australia.


So with many Indian nationals living in Australia, it‚Äôs only natural that we see many Indian influencers living or spending time in the country.

## üíº Indian Influencers Work With Indian Brands in Australia


Indian influencers based in Australia work hard to promote Indian products.


They work with Indian brands to spread awareness of their products among the Indian community in Australia. This is important as many Indians are still very loyal to their favorite Indian brands and they want to keep buying the same products in their new home.


However, it‚Äôs not just Indian brands that are taking advantage of the Indian influencer boom. Even big names are partnering with Indian influencers.


For instance, Luxluna is a 20-year-old Australian skincare company that sells vegan and cruelty-free Australian beauty products. They tapped into the Indian influencer market in Australia to help them promote their products in the Indian community.


Among others, they partnered with Ashika Sharma, an influential Indian beauty and lifestyle influencer based in Sydney. Luxluna paid Ashika an undisclosed amount to promote their powerful coffee facial scrub.


### üíµ How Much Do Indian Influencers Charge Brands for Promotional Posts?


The amount Indian influencers charge brands to promote their products varies depending on their popularity, reach, and engagement level.


The cost can also be influenced by the nature of the product being promoted.


For instance, Australian brands that sell products to Indian teachers, like Egis and Kookaburra, may have to offer Indian influencers a better deal than brands selling Indian snacks.


However, on average, Indian influencers in Australia charge the following amounts to promote brands on their Instagram pages:

1. 1,000 to 10,000 followers: between $50 and $200 per post
2. More than 10,000 followers: $200 to $500 per post
3. More than 100,000 followers: $1,000 to $2,500 per post
4. More than 500,000 followers: $2,500 to $10,000 per post
5. More than 1 million followers: $10,000 or more per post


## üòá Indian Influencers Have a Big Influence on Their Fellow Indians


Many Indian influencers have a very positive influence in Australia.

For instance, Indian beauty influencer Sahar B has been using her popularity to not only promote brands, but also to promote self-love among women. She believes that it is essential for women to embrace who they are regardless of their size, skin color, or background.


Sahar B is a model and influencer who is very passionate about body positivity. She has been using her platform to raise awareness about this very important issue.


One of her posts on Instagram that promotes body positivity and self-love has garnered over 15,000 likes and hundreds of comments from her followers who praise her for promoting self-love.


According to Sahar, her work with brands is quite rewarding. She says that she feels privileged to have many opportunities to work with brands that share her values and passion.


She says that using social media to get in touch with brands is a very simple process that anyone can do. She recommends that aspiring influencers keep their Instagram profiles public, so brands can find them easily, and they should also periodically check their direct messages, as many brands communicate via DMs.


### üë©üèΩ‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüë©üèª What is Body Positivity and Why is It Important?


Body positivity is a social movement that advocates for the acceptance of all bodies regardless of their shape, size, or skin color.


The aim is to challenge beauty standards that have been set by society that promote a narrow definition of beauty.


Body positivity is important as it helps to promote self-love, confidence, and healthy body image. It allows individuals to feel accepted and empowered in their own skin, and reduces negative body image and the risk of eating disorders.


Although body positivity was initially intended to be an inclusive movement that promotes self-love and acceptance for everyone, it has unfortunately come to be associated only with plus-size individuals. 

The movement has become a target for ridicule by many online. Those who ridicule the movement say that being plus-sized is unhealthy and they feel that it is dishonorable to advocate for plus-size individuals to embrace their bodies.


Some influencers have jumped on the body positivity bandwagon just for clout instead of genuinely championing the movement.


Nevertheless, many Indian influencers in Australia, like Sahar, have earned a spot in many hearts because of their incredible influence on the Indian community in Australia.
