K-Pop and K-Drama have made waves all over the world, and so has the social media platform, Naver.

It‚Äôs a hub for social interactions‚Äîespecially blogs. The platform is heavily utilized in South Korea, and the world has taken notice.  

In fact, as of 2021, South Koreans had the highest social media penetration rate in the world at 95%. The country has a total of 170 million social media accounts, which means the average South Korean has three accounts.

With Naver being a major player in the social media arena, influencer marketing on the platform is a big deal.  

So, if you‚Äôre looking to hire Naver influencers to promote your brand in South Korea, you‚Äôre on the right track. 

However, just how much will you have to pay?  


## üí∏ Pricing Overview

Naver blog influencers charge between $100 and $5,000 per marketing promotion.

Many factors contribute to their overall fees.  

For instance, the category of the influencer.  

A regular citizen influencer with a small following will charge about $100 to $200 for a single sponsored post.  

But, if you‚Äôre after a high-profile celebrity influencer, then you better have your checkbook ready.   

They can charge between $1,000 and $5,000 for a sponsored Naver blog post.  

Here‚Äôs a rough guide to Naver blog influencer fees below.  

| Category                   | Price                     |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Regular Citizen Influencer  | $100 to $200              |
| Mid-Level Influencer        | $300 to $1,000            |
| High-Level Influencer       | $1,000 to $5,000          |


## üì¢ Factors That Affect Pricing

Naver blog influencers charge different fees based on three main factors:  

### 1. üí∞ Level of Influence

The level of influence an influencer has is arguably the biggest factor that affects their pricing.  

In South Korea, influencers are categorized based on their follower counts. Here are the main categories:  

- **Regular Citizen Influencer:** 1K to 10K followers. 
- **Mid-Level Influencer:** 10K to 100K followers.
- **High-Level Influencer:** 100K followers and above.  

Typically, the more followers an influencer has, the bigger their outreach potential to your target market.   

Thus, the higher their fees.

### 2. üìù Type of Content

Some influencers create content that requires more effort than others.  

For instance, an influencer who specializes in creating graphics will take more time than one using text alone.  

Similarly, video content takes even more effort than that.   

Hence, influencers who produce more complicated content will charge higher fees.

### 3. ‚è≥ Sponsored Post Duration

How long you‚Äôll have the sponsored post live on the influencer‚Äôs Naver blog also affects pricing.  

Typically, the longer you‚Äôre allowed to keep the post live, the more the influencer will charge.  

That said, most influencers charge a standard fee, regardless of how long the post will be up.  

In most cases, it‚Äôs a permanent post, which is the best part of influencer marketing on blogs. 

Unlike social media posts, which can get buried by newer ones, blog posts stay live on the web indefinitely.  

Hence, you get continuous exposure over time.
