It's the land of smiles and street food, but Thailand is also one of the top destinations for Instagram influencers. 

Today everyone wants to work with a Thai influencer on Instagram, but how much will they charge for collaborations?

Letâ€™s take a look.

## ðŸ“Š 2025 Thailand Influencer Pricing Data

In 2023, the rates for collaborating with an influencer in Thailand ranged from 3,000 to 300,000 Thai baht. 

While most influencers had price tags equal to their follower count, some like Sabina Meiling, who has only 34,000 followers, can charge as much as 150,000 baht for a single Instagram post or video. 

Currently, Sabina is signed as a brand ambassador for Lâ€™Oreal Thailand. 

But Thailand influencer marketing is not limited to people with impressive follower counts; micro influencers like Coiny Who can charge upwards of 10,000 baht per post.

Coiny Who has been spotted in high-end accessory brand, TechnoMarine's campaigns.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of average Thailand influencer collaboration charges by tier and type in 2025.

| Influencer Tier | Post | Story | Reel |
| --------------- | ---- | ----- | ---- |
| Mega Influencer | 300,000 THB | 150,000 THB | 250,000 THB |
| Macro Influencer | 150,000 THB | 50,000 THB | 100,000 THB |

## ðŸ’¡ Thailand Influencer Marketing Metrics

With an average engagement rate of 3.26 percent, Thai influencers also have a high rate of trust among their followers, at 90%. 

That means working with an influencer will cost brands less than it would through other marketing channels that yield a similar return on investment.

In fact, 83% of Thai marketers have reported that influencer marketing provides the best results.

## âœˆ Thailand Influencer Marketing Payment Methods

When collaborating with influencers in Thailand, brands must be sure to pay them through their local bank accounts. 

Payments can take up to 7 business days, so it's best to leave at least 14 days on the calendar before posting.

For urgent collaborations, brands can pay influencers through PayPal, which allows them to transfer money through an email, and Binance, which allows them to transfer cryptocurrency. 

PayPal transactions take up to 3 business days for the influencer to receive the funds.

Binance allows for instant payments as long as both parties have set up a cryptocurrency wallet. 

Binance currently supports over 24 types of cryptocurrency.


## ðŸ“Ž Thailand Influencer Marketing Laws

While the Thailand advertising agency does not have strict laws around influencer payment disclosures like the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC), it is still good practice for Thai influencers to follow them.

According to official guidance from the Thai advertising agency, influencer disclosures can take several forms. 

The best way is to use hashtags in Instagram posts and stories, such as #sponsored, #gifted, or their Thai variants.

For example:
1. #à¹‚à¸†à¸©à¸“à¸² (advertisement)
2. #à¹‚à¸†à¸©à¸“à¸²à¹€à¸ªà¸µà¸¢à¸„à¹ˆà¸²à¹ƒà¸Šà¹‰à¸ˆà¹ˆà¸²à¸¢ (paid advertisement)
3. #à¹„à¸”à¹‰à¸£à¸±à¸šà¸œà¸¥à¸´à¸•à¸ à¸±à¸“à¸‘à¹Œà¸Ÿà¸£à¸µ (free product).


## âš¡ Conclusion

The charges for Thailand influencer marketing collaborations range from 5,000 to 300,000 THB.

And while advertising regulations do not require Thai influencers to disclose paid collaborations, it is still best practice to do so.
