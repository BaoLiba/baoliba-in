The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has become the pinnacle of success for Indians, South Asians, and other global races who are fortunate enough to land a job or a contract there.

Irrespective of their profession back home, immigrants find lucrative paths in the UAE that promise them luxury, comfort, and riches.

The same goes for Indian Instagram influencers who are looking for brand deals in UAE. 


## üõ´ The UAE is a popular country of influence


From B-Town celebs to Instagram influencers, the UAE remains a prime location for those looking to showcase themselves internationally.

Living and working in UAE not only gives one social acceptance back home, but also helps advance their career further.

As the country is home to a sizeable Indian population, that connection inspires them to relocate there.

Indian influencer Sussane Khan who moved to Dubai during the pandemic said it was her version of ‚Äúgoing to America.‚Äù 


## ‚úàÔ∏è Why UAE is the influencer paradise

The UAE attracts global influencers and brands from around the world. The fashion scene is lively, offering everything from luxury goods to regional masterpieces. The UAE is home to some of the biggest fashion and beauty events in the world, making it a key destination for international influencers and brands alike.

Fashionistas can attend exclusive events such as Arabian Fashion Week, The Arab Fashion Awards, and The Dubai Shopping Festival. Those who want to showcase their style can also explore the thriving fashion scene by attending fashion shows, exhibitions, and presentations.

In a fierce competition, brands are increasingly leveraging influencers to promote their products and services through sponsored posts and social media takeovers.

Tapping into a more authentic marketing approach, organizations like Hugo Boss, H&M, and Victoria‚Äôs Secret have partnered with social media stars from across the globe to promote their brands in the UAE.

Dubai-based influencer Aliya Bhatt is one of the most sought-after personalities in the region. She has done various brand deals including one with Dubai Tourism. 

‚ÄúDubai is unlike any other city in the world. Modern, vibrant and dynamic, it is a city that is always open for business and invests in the future,‚Äù Bhatt said.


## üíã Indians are popular influencers in the UAE 

Many Indian influencers have also secured brand deals in the UAE because of their popularity. 

Bollywood actress Kiara Advani recently became the ambassador of Dubai Tourism. 

Advani is one of the most followed Bollywood celebrities on Instagram in India and has a significant fanbase in the UAE.

She recently starred in the Dubai Tourism‚Äôs ‚ÄòDubai is Open‚Äô ad campaign promoting the iconic skyline and culture of Dubai. 

The campaign featured several other international influencers such as David Beckham, and David Guetta.


## üåá Indians love Dubai

UAE, especially Dubai, has long been a popular relocation destination for Indians. 

It is home to nearly 3 million Indians, constituting the largest expatriate community in the country. 

According to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), Indians account for over 30% of total property purchases in the UAE. 

An estimated one fifth of all Indians living outside the country are settled there.

The UAE has become an ultra-favored locale for Bollywood, with the city now hailed as the ‚ÄòDubaiwood‚Äô of India when it comes to films. 


## üé¨ Indian Celebs and Influencers go to Dubai

Big Bollywood celebrities such as Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, and Deepika Padukone regularly host events, shoots, and promotions there.

In 2020, Dubai hosted the red carpet premiere of the Bollywood film ‚ÄòGulabo Sitabo.‚Äô

Devraj Sanyal, Managing Director and CEO of Universal Music Group for India said, ‚ÄúIn a way, Dubai is the new Los Angeles of Bollywood.‚Äù

UAE is also a second home to its share of Instagram influencers as well.

Kashmiri influencer Aashna Shroff is a Dubai resident renowned across the globe for her fashion sense, beauty, and travel vlogs. 

She has brand partnerships with global brands like Huda Beauty, Dior, and L‚ÄôOreal.
