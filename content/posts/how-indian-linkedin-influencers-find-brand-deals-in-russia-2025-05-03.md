In recent years, Indian influencers on LinkedIn have emerged as a prominent force on the platform, making significant strides in various sectors, especially business and technology.

They have gained recognition for their unique approach to creating engaging content and have developed a distinct style that sets them apart from traditional influencers on platforms like Instagram and YouTube.

However, they are now facing one of their biggest challenges yet â€” an influx of Russian influencers into the space.

When Russia invaded Ukraine, creating a first world war in Europe, the West slapped Moscow with sanctions that blocked Russian influencers from advertising through global platforms like Instagram and Facebook.

This left a vacuum that their government plans to fill through LinkedIn, which has only recently launched its advertising services in Russia.

Russian influencers are now rushing to establish themselves on the platform before the advertising services are made available to them.

This has put Indian LinkedIn influencers in a unique predicament.

As a result, they are now competing with their Russian counterparts for brand deals with Russian companies who want to advertise to the Indian market.

Furthermore, they are also competing against LinkedIn influencers from other countries, such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, who are also vying for the same deals.

This has made it imperative for Indian LinkedIn influencers to take immediate action in order to secure their positions and ensure that they do not lose their competitive edge.

In India, there are two primary ways to secure brand deals on LinkedIn.

The first method involves directly reaching out to potential clients and pitching one's services as a LinkedIn influencer.

To do this, Indian LinkedIn influencers typically use the same strategies that one would use on any other platform.

This includes optimizing their profiles with relevant keywords, making connections with those in their target market, and engaging with content that is relevant to their industry.

Once they have established themselves, they then create a list of companies that they would like to work with, and send them personalized messages explaining how they can help them achieve their marketing goals.

The second method is by joining a LinkedIn influencer marketing agency, such as BaoLiba.

These agencies specialize in connecting brands with influencers who can promote their products or services to their audience on LinkedIn.

By joining one of these agencies, Indian LinkedIn influencers can gain access to a larger pool of potential clients and increase their chances of securing brand deals.

Since the rise of influencers on LinkedIn, there has also been an increase in the number of influencer marketing agencies that have sprung up to meet the growing demand for these services.

As a result, Indian LinkedIn influencers now have a plethora of options to choose from when it comes to joining an agency.

For example, they can join an agency that specializes in their industry, or one that focuses on a specific geographic area or target market.

This allows Indian LinkedIn influencers to find an agency that aligns with their niche and goals, and increases their chances of securing brand deals.

However, it is important to note that not all influencer marketing agencies are created equal.

Some agencies may not have a good reputation or may not be able to deliver on their promises.

As a result, Indian LinkedIn influencers should do their due diligence before joining an agency and ensure that it is reputable and has a track record of success.

Once they have secured a brand deal, the next step for Indian LinkedIn influencers is to create engaging content that will promote the client's product or service.

This is where Indian LinkedIn influencers have an advantage over their Russian counterparts.

While Russian influencers may have experience creating content for other platforms, they may not be familiar with the nuances of LinkedIn.

As a result, they may struggle to create content that resonates with LinkedIn users and fails to convert.

On the other hand, Indian LinkedIn influencers are well-versed in creating content that is tailored specifically for the platform.

They understand the types of content that perform well on LinkedIn, such as long-form articles, infographics, and case studies, and know how to leverage these formats to effectively promote their client's products or services.

Furthermore, Indian LinkedIn influencers also have a deep understanding of the platform's algorithms, which allows them to optimize their content to ensure that it gets maximum visibility.

This gives them a significant advantage over their Russian counterparts and increases their chances of success when promoting a client's product or service.

For example, one Indian LinkedIn influencer named Ramesh has secured a brand deal with a Russian vodka company that is looking to enter the Indian market.

In his posts, Ramesh has been highlighting how Russians drink vodka straight without ice or mix, which is something that Indians are not accustomed to.

However, he has also been showing how Russian men usually use vodka to toast to women in a show of respect, something that Indian men can learn from, especially when courting women.

This unique selling proposition has helped Ramesh create engaging content that resonates with his audience and promotes the client's product effectively.

Another Indian LinkedIn influencer named Sunil has secured a brand deal with a Russian diamond company that is looking to enter the Indian market.

In his posts, Sunil has been highlighting how Russians use diamonds not only as a form of jewelry but also as a display of wealth.

As a result, he has also been showing how Indians can do the same, especially in business settings, where displaying wealth is crucial.

This unique selling proposition has also helped Sunil create engaging content that resonates with his audience and promotes the client's product effectively.

At the end of the day, it is important to remember that Indian LinkedIn influencers will not be the only ones vying for brand deals in the Russian market.

As previously mentioned, influencers from Pakistan and Bangladesh are also competing for the same deals.

This means that Indian LinkedIn influencers will need to step up their game and find ways to differentiate themselves from the competition.

Once they have secured a brand deal, Indian LinkedIn influencers must also ensure that they get paid for their work.

This can often be a challenge, especially when dealing with companies from other countries.

In the case of working with Russian companies, Indian LinkedIn influencers must be especially cautious.

While Russia has a reputation for being a rogue state, they also have a reputation for being good payers.

This is largely due to the fact that they have been locked out of international financial systems and have resorted to paying in cryptocurrency.

As a result, Indian LinkedIn influencers must ensure that they have a way to accept payment in cryptocurrency if they want to work with Russian companies.

Fortunately, there are several options available for those looking to get paid in cryptocurrency.

For example, Indian LinkedIn influencers can use a cryptocurrency wallet, such as Coinbase or Binance, to receive payments directly.

Alternatively, they can also use a payment processor, such as BitPay or CoinGate, that accepts cryptocurrency and converts it to fiat currency.

This allows Indian LinkedIn influencers to get paid in cryptocurrency without having to deal with the hassle of managing a wallet.

While receiving payment in cryptocurrency can present some challenges, it is important to note that it also has its advantages.

For one, cryptocurrency transactions are typically faster and cheaper than traditional payment methods.

Additionally, cryptocurrency also offers a level of security and anonymity that is not possible with traditional payment methods.

This can be especially beneficial for Indian LinkedIn influencers who are working with Russian companies, as it can help protect their sensitive financial information.

In conclusion, Indian LinkedIn influencers have a unique opportunity to secure brand deals with Russian companies looking to enter the Indian market.

By utilizing influencer marketing agencies, optimizing their profiles, and creating engaging content, they can increase their chances of success when competing against influencers from other countries.

Additionally, by using cryptocurrency payment methods, they can ensure that they get paid for their work and enjoy the benefits that come with it.

As the situation in Russia continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how Indian LinkedIn influencers adapt and capitalize on this emerging trend.
