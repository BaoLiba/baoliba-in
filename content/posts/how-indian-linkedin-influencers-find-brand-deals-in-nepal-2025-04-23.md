Although there are influencers in Nepal, Indian influencers on LinkedIn are better at finding brand deals. Here’s how they do it.


### 🤝 LinkedIn is serious business in Nepal

Nepal’s influencers use other platforms like Instagram more than LinkedIn, but LinkedIn is a great way to network and do business. 

Their audiences are entrepreneurs, and most of them work with brands that cater to businesses. This is exactly what an influencer marketing strategy should be, targeted at the right audience. 

Most Nepali influencers are aware of this, but they just can’t compete with Indians when it comes to LinkedIn.

Even with a local flair, most marketing strategies in Nepal look to India. From Nepal Bihari Nepali to QFX Cinemas, many Nepali companies look to India for inspiration.

According to local influencer and digital marketing consultant Niraj Poudel, brands in Nepal are 10-20% of the way toward understanding influencer marketing strategies.


### 🥇 Indian LinkedIn influencers are just better

If a Nepali brand wants to use a LinkedIn influencer, they will most likely reach out to an Indian influencer. 

This isn’t a slight against Nepali influencers, they are good at other platforms and they’re usually first to engage when it comes to influencer marketing.

The reason Indian LinkedIn influencers are preferred is that they know how to get the most from the platform. 

They are persistent, consistent and they’ll engage the audience in ways that Nepali influencers just can’t. 

For example, if someone liked their post, an Indian influencer would like their post back if they had one. 

They understand organic growth on LinkedIn and all the intricacies involved. 

When it comes to influencer marketing, the influencer matters.  

Delhi based influencer and author of “LinkedIn Secrets of Success” Kunal Gupta has grown his audience on LinkedIn to over 1.1 million followers. 


### 📈 Kangaroo and other Nepali brands are going to India for LinkedIn influencers

Nepali brands aren’t using Indian influencers just because they are better at LinkedIn, it’s also that they feel better working with an Indian influencer.

According to a report by KMR Events and Research Institute, 66% of marketing professionals in Nepal feel that Indian influencers perform better. 

This means they are more likely to convert, if they can reach someone during the awareness stage of the funnel, they can guide them all the way to a purchase.

Nepal’s Kangaroo Industrial Coporation has worked with many Indian LinkedIn influencers because of this.

The brand is widely recognized as having the best quality steel products in Nepal.

Nepal has better options when it comes to steel products, but Kangaroo just happens to be the best. 

Just like steel, Kangaroo understands quality when it comes to getting the best returns from a brand deal.


### 🗣️ Nepali brands have a unique need when it comes to influencers

Nepali brands have special requirements and Indian influencers can deliver. 

According to local influencer and digital marketer Niraj Poudel, they need someone that understands both Asian and Western cultures. 

“They need someone who knows the rare and delicate balance between the Asian tradition and the Western modernism,” he said. 

Indian influencers are time travelers when it comes to marketing. 

They can target any time zone because someone in India is always awake. 

They can stay up late working on a campaign for a Nepali brand because they understand the local dynamics and needs. 


### 🔍 Brands need the right kind of targeting and Indian influencers can deliver 

Local influencers are best when brands take a holistic approach to influencer marketing.

Brands in Nepal need to also look at how someone became a LinkedIn influencer.

Many Indian influencers use LinkedIn Growth Hacking to grow their audience. 

Former tech lead for Web 3.0 at Holochain India’s own Arjun Raj took LinkedIn by storm because he leveraged personal branding.

He grew his audience to over 55,000 followers, all while working on projects that would make the internet better. 

Local brands can find this kind of influencer in India and this is vital for successful campaigns.


### ✋🏼 Nepal has its share of LinkedIn influencers

While Indian influencers have the upper hand, Nepal has its share of LinkedIn influencers too.

One local influencer is Dr. Madan K. Uprety, MD. He is a managing director and consultant for Uprety Eye and Health Center and has over 100,000 followers on LinkedIn. 

He also specializes in providing remote healthcare services and his audience extends far beyond Nepal. 

He has worked with many international brands including Google and Johnson and Johnson, helping them understand ophthalmology in South Asia.

According to Dr. Uprety, both Indian and Nepali influences can work together to help Nepali brands get the best returns from influencer marketing.
