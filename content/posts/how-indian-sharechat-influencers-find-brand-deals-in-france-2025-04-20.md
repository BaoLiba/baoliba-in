In recent years, a growing number of influencers from India are breaking into the lucrative market of France. Influencers on ShareChat, one of the most popular apps in India, are especially well known for targeting France's large Indian student population.

In fact, India recently overtook China as the largest foreign student population in France, according to the latest figure from the OECD. This shift has prompted French companies to leverage Indian talent online, by sourcing influencers from India itself.

With a burgeoning Indian population in France, Indian influencers are well positioned to capitalize on this growing market. They have a cultural understanding of French Indian audiences, and they already speak their native languages as well, predominantly Hindi and Tamil, which gives them a competitive edge.

What was once a challenge for Indian influencers operating abroad, far away from their natural audience, is now being lifted as they can use their homegrown influence to engage directly with local audiences at destination.

## üì¢ Is the French Indian Influencer Market Growing?

It is undeniable that the number of Indian influencers targeting France is increasing. Luxury watch retailers, hair extensions, and fashion brands are just some of the products that these influencers have been promoting.

In France, Indian cuisine is also becoming increasingly popular and Indian influencers have taken note. In December 2022, ShareChat influencer, Kumud Sharma, was invited to promote a high-end Indian restaurant named Nawaab in Paris.

In fact, Kumud is one of many influencers from India who have made France their new hotspot for brand sponsorships. She has a growing reputation as a premier French Indian influencer influencer on ShareChat.

With the opportunity ahead of them, Kumud and other ShareChat influencers in India are figuring out how to secure brand deals in France.

## ‚ùó How are Influencers on ShareChat Finding Brand Deals in France?

Unlike influencers hailing from the US or the UK, Indian influencers from ShareChat do not simply go on to websites like Influenster or Izea to find brand deals. Instead, they are relying on their own homegrown influencers marketing platforms to find sponsors.

In India, ShareChat influencers can benefit from numerous influencer platforms, each serving a distinct need for their influencer marketing campaigns. Organizations like BrandBuddha, Verve, and BaoLiba amongst others, are leading the charge in connecting influencers with brands.

#### üìä BaoLiba: A Leading Indian Influencer Marketing Platform

Chinese-based TikTok has long dominated Indian short-form content, but now Indian apps like ShareChat are leading the way. Despite having similar features, ShareChat has a distinct advantage over TikTok.

While TikTok has aggressive censorship restrictions imposed by the communist party in mainland China, ShareChat has no such issues under its Indian governance. As a result, ShareChat has begun to secure long-standing contracts with international brands.

Leading the charge amongst influencer marketing platforms is BaoLiba. They are currently working with influencers on ShareChat to secure contracts with brands across Europe.

In late October 2022, BaoLiba helped influencer Sonal Singh secure a lucrative brand deal with Crystal, a Parisian luxury beauty company.

The success of ShareChat influencers being able to find brand deals in France can be attributed to influencers marketing platforms like BaoLiba. They are customized to suit local influencers and help them secure brand sponsorships, no matter the geography.

### üí° India Has a Growing Population of Students in France

As previously mentioned, the rise of Indian nationals studying abroad has resulted in more Indian influencers securing brand deals overseas. No major city in France is immune to the growing influence of Indians, especially Paris.

In 2023 alone, more than 43,000 Indian students moved to France. In total, there are more than 112,000 Indian students currently enrolled in French schools and universities. In 2022, there were only 40,000 students, according to the latest figure provided by the French Agency for the Development of Campus France.

France is also the second most popular destination for Indian students, coming in only behind the US, according to the French Embassy in India. 

For Indian influencers, this presents a significant opportunity to cater their content and marketing directly to locals in France.

#### üì¢ France is Host to over 112,000 Indian Nationals

According to a survey conducted by IFOP for the Indian Chamber of Commerce in France, the community has now exceeded 112,000 people. This includes over 85,000 Indian nationals living in the Paris region.

According to the same report, 80% of French Indians live in Paris. This represents 40% of the entire Indian diaspora in France. 

The Indian community, which has grown by about 12% annually over the past 10 to 15 years, is now the largest among foreign communities in France.

In its 2025 forecast, the report predicts that the Indian community in France will reach 200,000 by 2025.

#### ‚ùó Tamil Nadu is France's Third Largest Tourist Market

When the French government announced the easing of visa restrictions for Indians, it was met with overwhelming support from Tamil Nadu. The large influx of students from Tamil Nadu have also been attributed to the increasing number of visitors coming from the state.

France is Tamil Nadu's third largest tourist destination, behind only Singapore and the United States. 

The French Parliament is now looking to safeguard the growing bilateral relations between Tamil Nadu and France. Tamil Nadu accounts for 55% of Indian visitors to France.

In March 2023, the French government announced a campaign to boost tourism amongst Indian nationals. This includes a 40% increase in flight routes from India.

#### üîë Key Takeaways

- There are currently over 112,000 Indian nationals living in France 
- Tamil Nadu accounts for 55% of Indian visitors to France
- French Indians are the largest foreign national group in France
- France is the second most popular destination for Indian students abroad

## ‚òëÔ∏è What Do Influencers on ShareChat Think of BaoLiba?

Many Indian influencers on ShareChat are starting to see the value in using BaoLiba to secure brand deals in France. 

One of the first influencers to work with BaoLiba was influencer Sonal Singh. She has a significant following of over 2.5 million followers on ShareChat and is also one of the most well-known influencers in France.

When asked about her experiences with BaoLiba, Sonal remarked, ‚ÄúThe team helped me secure a brand deal with Crystal Paris, a popular skincare company in France. They have their own influencer marketing platform just like ShareChat, so influencers like myself can easily find sponsors.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn't want to switch over to TikTok or every popular short-form video app. I wanted to stay on ShareChat because that is where my fans are. But I also wanted to get paid and work with brands, and that's where BaoLiba helped me,‚Äù Sonal added.

## üí° Influencers from ShareChat are Tapping into Existing Markets

Although French Indians are looking for Indian influencers to make sponsorship deals with, their numbers are still small. In order to succeed, influencers must tap into existing markets that are already in France.

Fortunately, many Indians in France are already benefitting from the established Indian markets that are present across the continent. 

French Indians can often be spotted in French Indian markets and stores, especially in Paris. 

Influencers can also tap into existing Indian markets in countries surrounding France like Belgium, Germany, and Switzerland. 

The European Union allows for the free movement of people across European borders, meaning that influencers can easily travel across Europe to complete more brand deals in neighboring countries. 

#### üì¢ Market Size of Indian Grocery Stores in France

The number of Indian grocery stores in France was small just a few years ago. According to estimates, there are now more than 30 Indian grocery stores throughout France.

According to estimates from vendors and experts, the Indian grocery business in France is estimated to be worth around 100 million euros, with an annual growth rate of nearly 15 percent.

As the demand for Indian products increases, so does the need for Indian grocery stores, especially in cities where there are already established Indian communities.

Grocery stores like Asha's Indian Grocery in Paris, as well as stores like Madras Masala in Lyon and La Petite Inde in Marseille are leading the charge in catering to the needs of local French Indians. 

Influencers from ShareChat can leverage these stores to find brand deals in France.

Asha‚Äôs Indian Grocery in Paris is owned by a woman named Asha Dutt. She moved to Paris in 1989 and opened the store just five years later.

New Delhi born chef and influencer Kunal Kapur partnered with Asha in April 2023. He created a web series that showcases Indian cuisine across four episodes, highlighting a dish from each of the four regions of India. 

In addition to traditional French Indian cuisine, Indian influencers can leverage the burgeoning Indian beverage sector in France.

According to surveys, Indian liquor is becoming increasingly popular in France. Whisky and rum are becoming especially well-known amongst French Indians. 

French Indians are also benefitting from the establishment of several Indian beverage companies in France, including brands like Itsy and Dharmadi. 

#### üì¢ The Growth of the Indian Beverage Market in France

According to reports, the Indian beverage market in France is worth over 1.5 billion euros and is growing at an estimated rate of over 20 percent each year.

The main driver of this booming Indian liquor market in France is the surging popularity of Indian whisky.

The report mentions that coastal regions of southern France where tourists flock, such as Lyon and Marseille, are particularly prime markets for Indian whisky. 

Sales of Indian whisky have been relatively strong throughout France, rising by 30% on average. This is notably higher than more established Scotch whisky brands.

#### üìä Key Takeaways

- The Indian beverage market in France is worth 1.5 billion euros
- Sales of Indian whisky across France have risen by 30%
- The Indian grocery business in France is estimated to be worth 100 million euros
