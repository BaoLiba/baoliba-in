Despite their geographic proximity, brands in Bangladesh are now reaching out to social media influencers from India to help sell their products and services to the local audience. On Twitter especially, Indian influencers have become a popular choice for companies in Bangladesh that want to tap into the subcontinent‚Äôs second largest consumer market. 

More and more Bangladeshi brands are opting for Indian Twitter influencers while relegating homegrown content creators to the back burner. 


## üöß What is Behind the Trend? 

A major reason why brands in Bangladesh are reaching out to Indian Twitter influencers is the longevity and respect Indian social media influencers command among audiences in the country.

Since its inception, the Bangladeshi social media landscape has been plagued by accusations of spreading false information and a reluctance to hold brands accountable for their products and services. 

In contrast, Indian Twitter influencers are known to champion consumer welfare while being vocal about issues that matter to the audience. 


## üß≥ How Do Bangladeshi Brands Reach Out to Indian Twitter Influencers?

While many Bangladeshi brands have been reaching out to Indian Twitter influencers directly through their profiles, others have been employing the help of social media marketing agencies. 

According to a recent article by the Dhaka Tribune, Bangladeshi social media marketing agencies are becoming increasingly reliant on Indian Twitter influencers to fulfill the expectations of their clients. 

Owing to the kind of respect and trust Indian Twitter influencers command among the audience in Bangladesh, brands are pressuring Bangladeshi social media marketing agencies to enlist their services for promotional campaigns. 


## üî© How Do Indian Twitter Influencers Get Paid?

While Bangladeshi brands do have the option of sending payments through electronic means like internet banking, most of them prefer to send cash. 

Italian and Indian tourists frequenting Bangladesh have been noticed to use the same payment app called bKash to pay for vacation packages, shopping, and food.  

That is because bKash, which is a local mobile payment service, does not require a bank account. 

Yet, bKash accounts cannot be funded directly from foreign bank accounts. This means Bangladeshi brands and social media marketing agencies will need to enlist the help of a local citizen in Bangladesh who has a bKash account to fund it. 

Once they have a bKash account funded, local Bangladeshi brands can simply send money to the Indian Twitter influencer through their bKash account. 


## ‚ùó What Should Indian Twitter Influencers Keep in Mind? 

According to a report by the Daily Star, Bangladeshi banks have been cracking down on transactions made via bKash mobile payment service. 

The Bangladesh Bank slapped bKash with a fine of BDT 3 crore on January 17 and a further BDT 25 crore on January 25.  

Both fines were imposed for not maintaining the correct amount of deposits as directed by the Bangladesh Bank.   

According to the Daily Star, the current account balance of bKash on January 15 was BDT 491 crore but should have been BDT 435 crore. 

This means that not all payments may be sent through bKash for Indian Twitter influencers. 

In addition, the Bangladesh Bank is reportedly working on bringing bKash under its supervision. 


## üì¢ How Can Bangladeshi Brands Avoid Scams?

There is always a risk of scams whenever payments are made in cash, but Bangladeshi brands and agencies can protect themselves by following a couple of simple rules. 

First, Indian Twitter influencers who are being approached for a promotional deal should agree to only receive payment after they have completed the promotional campaign.

Second, Bangladeshi brands and social media marketing agencies should also make sure that the Indian Twitter influencers they hire have a history of making similar posts about brands that are relevant to their products and services. 

For example, a Bangladeshi mobile telecommunications company trying to reach out to teenagers may find it relevant to work with an Indian comedian or actor who has made similar promotional posts about mobile telecommunications companies in India. 

Most importantly, Bangladeshi brands should demand that Indian Twitter influencers show proof that they have made the posts they promised to make.  

Finally, when using bKash to send payments, they should only deal with trusted individuals. 


## üß≠ Are Indian Twitter Influencers Better Than Local Ones?

Indian Twitter influencers may have an easier time establishing credibility among the audience in Bangladesh, but they may not always be better than local ones. 

Research by market research firm Ipsos revealed that audiences tend to trust local influencers more than their foreign counterparts. 

While both local and foreign influencers are valuable for promotional campaigns, it‚Äôs crucial that companies in Bangladesh find a balance between the two. 


## üöß Why Are Bangladeshi Brands Using Indian Twitter Influencers?

Brands in Bangladesh may be using Indian Twitter influencers for a couple of reasons. 

First, they may be resorting to Indian Twitter influencers simply because they have been prompted by social media marketing agencies, which have come under increasing pressure from their clients. 

Second, while Indian Twitter influencers do have a history of being vocal about issues that matter to the audience and championing consumer rights, that is generally only the case for local brands. 

When foreign brands reach out to Indian Twitter influencers to promote their products and services, they tend to gloss over issues that matter to their audiences and champion the interests of the foreign brands instead. 

This generally leads to Indian Twitter influencers making promotional posts that fail to deliver consistent messaging and are otherwise misleading. 


## üì¢ Is the Trend Here to Stay?

Marketing experts expect the trend of Bangladeshi brands using Indian Twitter influencers to stay for the foreseeable future. 

The reasons, according to them, are the kind of respect and credibility Indian Twitter influencers command among audiences in Bangladesh, as well as the lack thereof among local influencers. 

Furthermore, as more and more Bangladeshi brands reach out to Indian Twitter influencers and social media marketing agencies rely on them more, it is bound to create a snowball effect. 

Competitors will want to use Indian Twitter influencers too, leading to more social media marketing agencies enlisting their services, and so on. 

While this article has tried to present an accurate description of what is happening in Bangladesh, it is an ongoing story.

## üöß Are Bangladeshi Brands Using Indian Twitter Influencers to Avoid Backlashes?

Many Bangladeshi brands have used social media marketing agencies that employed local influencers to reach out to users about their products and services. 

Yet, many of them ended up facing backlashes instead of achieving their objectives. 

For example, online delivery and e-commerce platform Jomunabazar faced backlash for using Local YouTuber Amna as a brand ambassador. 

This is because Amna is known for producing content for her YouTube channel that are filled with misinformation about COVID-19, among other social issues. 

Jomunabazar was forced to terminate their service agreement with Amna. 

Going with Indian Twitter influencers may help Bangladeshi brands sidestep backlash because Indian Twitter influencers have a history of posting truthful and relatable content. 

Starit, a Bangladeshi clothing brand, faced backlash after UK-based Bangladeshi influencer Aima Jmon posted a TikTok about their cloth. 

Starit‚Äôs reputation was left tarnished as many of their customers left angry comments on their social media platforms. 

Starit‚Äôs CEO admitted to not doing proper research before reaching out to the influencer.
