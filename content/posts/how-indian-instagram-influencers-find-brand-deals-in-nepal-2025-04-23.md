As a budding influencer, you know the importance of diversifying your brand deals. But what happens if you're an Indian influencer who's run out of deals back home? 

Enter Nepal, a neighboring nation known for its stunning vistas, mouth-watering food, and most importantly, its treasure trove of influencer marketing dollars just waiting to be collected.

Nepal's influencer marketing industry is small but growing and is generating healthy brand deals within and outside of the country. As of 2023, reports have indicated that Nepal's influencer marketing industry is worth over NPR 1 billion (~USD 7.7 million).

If you're looking to penetrate the world of Nepalese brand deals, here is the lowdown on what it takes for Indian influencers to successfully strike brand deals in Nepal.

## üìà Nepal is a Growing Domain for Influencer Marketers

While influencer marketing in Nepal is still in its infancy, it is outpacing Indian influencer marketing growth statistics. According to reports, the Nepalese influencer marketing industry has grown by 2,200% since 2020. Meanwhile, just 87% since 2020 in the Indian market.

Nepal‚Äôs influencer industry growth is attributed to the rise of social media adoption and the younger population in Nepal. According to Statista, about 54% of the Nepalese population were active social media users in January 2023.

This is a sign that as their influencer ecosystem matures, international influencers will have even more opportunities for brand deals in Nepal.

## üë©‚Äçüè´ The Challenges Held by Nepalese Brands

Despite the growth of the influencer marketing industry in Nepal, renowned influencer marketing pundits have expressed frustration at the dearth of top local creators.

With the lack of established Nepalese influencers, Indian influencers are coming in to fill the gaps in the market. 

Speaking to a Nepalese influencer marketing manager working for a local clothing brand, he expressed: "The influencer marketing landscape in Nepal is relatively barren. Many of our local influencers are also afraid to venture outside of selfies and lifestyle posts. This means that brands have no choice but to look overseas for influencers who can create professional content for promotional campaigns."

The demand for Indian influencers is so great that some are even being flown to Nepal to shoot at some of the most glamorous landmarks. 

Speaking with Ivy, a Nepalese influencer manager who works with the Himalayan Infinity Group, she stated: "Just last week, we flew in an Indian influencer to shoot a promotional campaign at the Taj Mahal of Nepal! He had over 100,000 followers and was a travel influencer, something that is very hard to come by in Nepal. Right now, we are in discussions to bring him back for a second campaign."

## üîé Identifying Top Nepalese Brands 

As is the case with most international influencer marketing endeavors, the most crucial first step is discovering top brands in Nepal that are actively looking for influencers. 

To do so, Indian influencers can start with a simple Google search. 

Here are a few keywords that can be entered into Google to reveal top brands and companies in Nepal that are looking for influencers:

1. brand name + "influencer"
2. "Nepal influencer opportunity"
3. "Nepal influencer marketing"
4. "Nepal brands looking for influencers"
5. business name + "profile" + "Nepal"
6. business name + "team" + "Nepal"
7. business name + "contact" + "Nepal"

As many business websites have specialized pages for their teams, Google sometimes reveals them in searches. 

For example, trying "Himalayan Infinity Group contact Nepal" shows you a direct link to their contact page. This means you can easily contact them for collaborations!

For established brands like Himalaya, MTR Foods, and Nescafe, Indian influencers can check the user-generated content they receive on their Instagram posts. 

Many brands often repost content created by influencers. Under the photos they repost, users can usually find the original creator's profile, which means you can discover more creators.

From conducting a simple search to finding top brands, this is the first step towards landing brand deals in Nepal.

## ‚úÖ Utilizing the Right Influencing Platforms

While social media is essential, influencer marketing platforms specifically designed for collaboration can help simplify the process of finding top brands in Nepal. 

Here are some of the top platforms for Indian influencers to land brand deals in Nepal:

1. **NepalInfluencer**
2. **Khaalko Bato**
3. **Influencers Nepal**

These platforms are specifically designed to connect Nepalese influencers with brands. However, they're also a great resource for Indian creators looking to penetrate Nepal‚Äôs influencer marketing scene.

If you don‚Äôt currently have any representation, you can still reach out to these platforms to see if they‚Äôre accepting new influencers. 

NepalInfluencer, for example, currently has no mention of whether they're only representing Nepalese influencers. Therefore, it‚Äôs possible that Indian creators can apply for representation.

## üè¶ Payment Platforms Nepalese Brands Use

For Indian influencers, the next step is to learn how they can be compensated once they land a brand deal in Nepal.

Fortunately, the payment platforms that many agencies and brands in Nepal utilize already have a global reach, which means Indian influencers won't have any issues cashing in after successful campaigns.

Here are the top payment platforms that most brands in Nepal use to pay their influencers:

1. **PayPal**
2. **Wise**
3. **Skrill**
4. **Local bank transfers**

Among these platforms, PayPal is the most widely accepted platform for brands to transfer payments to their influencers. 

Most influencers who have worked with brands in Nepal confirm that they were paid through PayPal. 

However, unconfirmed reports have also stated that some brand deals have relied on local banking methods, meaning Indian influencers must have access to a local bank account in Nepal.

This may prove to be challenging to organize, so it may be best for Indian influencers to focus on payment platforms that are universally accepted, like PayPal.

## üìù The Legal Framework of Nepalese Brand Deals

Many influencers from India may be wary of traveling to Nepal for brand deals. 

This is understandable considering that India and Nepal share a complex history. Being neighbors doesn't mean that they always get along! 

While the good times have always outweighed the bad, there are still lingering sentiments and tensions present amongst many citizens of both countries. 

However, Indian influencers can rest assured that brand deals in Nepal are completely legitimate as the country ranks high for foreigners looking to do business.

According to the 2023 Ease of Doing Business Index compiled by the World Bank, Nepal ranks higher than countries like India, Myanmar, and China (see below):

- Nepal: 105th place
- India: 134th place
- Myanmar: 147th place
- China: 151st place

Influencers looking to travel to Nepal for brand deals will not need to apply for a tourist visa, as Indian citizens are eligible for visa-free entry into the country. 

They can travel solely on an Aadhar card or any other official government-issued ID.

## üèÑ Expect the Unexpected

While Nepal is generally a safe place to conduct influencer marketing, sometimes you may find yourself in the midst of political protests and demonstrations while filming your content. 

Nepal has a long history of protests, especially in the capital of Kathmandu.

While they are mostly harmless, it is best to steer clear of protest sites as they may disrupt your filming schedule. 

Demonstrations usually take place during daytime hours, so filming in the early morning or late afternoon can help you avoid any conflict.

## üì± Use WhatsApp as Your Primary Communication Tool

While those traveling from India to Nepal will find that many apps and services work just the same as back home, they will experience difficulties using services like Messenger, Google Duo, or other social media-based calling services. 

Therefore, WhatsApp is the best way to contact your brand partners in Nepal.

WhatsApp works just like regular messaging apps, but it uses WiFi or cellular data instead of call minutes, which means you can stay in contact with your brand partners without worrying about running up your phone bill!

## ü§ü Conclusion 

Nepal is a hidden gem for Indian influencers to find brand deals. 

With many local influencers being unable to deliver the quality content that brands demand, Indian influencers can easily slide into their DMs and fill in the gaps in Nepal's influencer marketing landscape.

While it may be relatively easy to strike brand deals in Nepal, influencers should still ensure that they are protecting themselves and their content.

This means reading contracts thoroughly, negotiating fair compensation, and ensuring proper credit is received for all promotional content.

By doing this, Indian influencers can establish long-lasting relationships with brands in Nepal that are mutually beneficial for all parties involved.
