In a world where social media influencers are the new celebrities,  the realm of marketing is rapidly shifting. Traditionally, Indian influencers have worked with local brands, but now they are venturing overseas, particularly in Germany.

This shift is evident as Indian influencers are beginning to find brand deals in Germany, especially on Twitter. While German influencers have long been a staple in Germany, they are now working with Indian brands, and Indian influencers are beginning to work with German brands.

India and Germany are also just beginning a new stage in their relationship and commerce and trade between the two countries are expected to flourish. 

This article will explore how Indian Twitter influencers are finding brand deals in Germany, how German brands are just beginning to reach out to Indian influencers, and whether this trend is likely to continue.


## üìä Background

As the world continues to globalize, it is only natural that India and Germany become more intertwined in terms of trade and commerce. 

In 2020, Germany was India‚Äôs largest trading partner in Europe, and bilateral trade is expected to more than double over the next few years. In 2019, India‚Äôs Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal even stated that bilateral trade should reach ‚Ç¨40 billion by 2025.

Both countries are also taking steps to foster bilateral trade. In 2021, India and Germany agreed to a new pact to boost cooperation in various sectors including trade and commerce. 

The closer ties between both countries are also expected to lead to an increase in tourism. In 2022, a group of German MPs led by economist Hans-J√ºrgen Thies even visited India to discuss the bilateral ties and how to increase German tourism to India. 

The burgeoning tourism sector is already evident as more Indians are traveling to Germany and more Germans are traveling to India. 

In 2019, there were nearly 900,000 arrivals from Germany to India, and this number is expected to increase due to the closer ties between both countries. 

This increase in travel and tourism is expected to create more opportunities for both Indian and German influencers as travel and lifestyle brands begin to seek influencers in foreign markets in order to reach more customers.

For Indian influencers, the prospect of working with brands in Germany is now a possibility as the closer ties between both countries create more opportunities.

According to a report from Global Travel Insights, Germany is projected to become one of the most visited countries in the world by 2025. This report also indicated that as more Germans travel abroad, the need for marketing through influencers will also increase.

In this environment, social media influencers from India are expected to continue to find brand deals in Germany, especially on Twitter.


## ‚ùó Current state

Despite the strong indicators that suggest that Indian Twitter influencers are heading for brand deals in Germany, the reality is quite different. 

The majority of Indian Twitter influencers currently do not have brand deals with Germany. Most still focus on local brands and that is primarily due to the payment processes between both countries. 

Local brands often pay Indian influencers in Indian Rupees, yet most German brands are unable to do so as they primarily operate in Euros. 

Currently, most Indian influencers that can work with German brands use digital wallets or payment platforms such as Paypal or Payoneer to accept payments in Euros. 

However, the vast majority of Indian influencers still do not have access to such platforms and so cannot work with international brands, even if they wish to. 

Even those influencers that do have access to such platforms often have to wait days or weeks in order to receive their payments. 

Additionally, even those that receive payments in Euros may prefer to receive payments in their local currency. 

This may also lead to the perception from some Indian Twitter influencers that German brands are less trustworthy than local brands, due to the payment delays. 

Despite this reality, there are signs that suggest that the need for Indian influencers is rising in Germany, as Indian influencers are also becoming more popular within Germany. 

A recent report found that there is a growing fascination with Indian culture and entertainment in Germany. The report found that many Germans are increasingly drawn to Bollywood films and Indian music. 

This trend presents an opportunity for Indian influencers, especially on Twitter. 

Currently, Indian Twitter influencers are more popular than German influencers in India, and this popularity could translate to Germany as Indian influencers continue to expand their reach. 


## ü§ù The future

Despite the current payments issues, Indian Twitter influencers are already beginning to find brand deals in Germany. 

As previously mentioned, the international payments landscape is currently evolving, and many Indian influencers are already finding streamlined ways to receive payments from German brands. 

As the demand for Indian influencers in Germany increases, we expect to see more Indian Twitter influencers begin to find brand deals in Germany. 

This demand is already evident as several German brands have already approached Indian influencers for brand deals.

For example, a German brand called Neumanndesign contacted an Indian Twitter influencer called Aditya that has nearly 100,000 followers to create a tweet that showcases the brand‚Äôs stainless steel products. 

Aditya stated that he was contacted directly by the company‚Äôs CEO and that the brand was interested in him as he was a fan of their products. 

In another case, a German brand called Fickstutzen contacted an Indian Twitter influencer called Ashish to promote their products. 

The brand even created a thread about the brand deal that highlighted how much the German brand was willing to pay Ashish for the promotion. 

In the thread, Ashish stated that he was paid ‚Ç¨500 for the promotion, which is equivalent to ‚Çπ44,000. 

As more Indian Twitter influencers begin to find brand deals in Germany, we can expect this trend to continue. 

As more Indian Twitter influencers find brand deals in Germany, it is likely that more German brands will seek Indian influencers to promote their products. 

Additionally, as more Indian Twitter influencers find brand deals in Germany, it is likely that more Indian Twitter influencers will seek brand deals in Germany.

Lastly, as more Indian Twitter influencers find brand deals in Germany, it is likely that more brands will seek Indian influencers to promote their products. 

This trend is expected to continue as long as the demand for Indian influencers in Germany continues to rise. 

## ü§î Conclusion

The world is rapidly changing, and this includes the marketing landscape. As social media influencers continue to rise in popularity, it is only logical that they will begin to find brand deals outside their home countries.

As the relationship between India and Germany continues to flourish, Indian Twitter influencers are beginning to find brand deals in Germany, especially on Twitter. 

Despite the current payments issues, the signs are already there that suggest that Indian Twitter influencers will continue to find brand deals in Germany in the future, as the need for Indian influencers continues to rise in Germany. 

As the demand for Indian influencers continues to rise in Germany, we can expect this trend to continue.
