According to reports by The Economic Times, India is expected to be the second-largest source of social media influencers in the world after the USA by 2025. That's a whopping 24% of the global influencer community! 

This increase has been attributed to the growing trend of influencer marketing in India, which has already begun to attract foreign clients. 

While many Indian influencers have already started creating content for international brands, it was mostly the usual suspects from the USA, Singapore, and Europe.  

However, in a surprising development, major Japanese brands have begun working exclusively with Indian Twitter influencers for their promotional campaigns. 

Here are the reasons behind this unusual trend and how Indian Twitter influencers have managed to score brand deals in Japan. 

## 📊 The sudden rise of Indian Twitter influencers in Japan

Recently, many Indian Twitter influencers have claimed that they have received personal invites from Japanese brands to promote their products on Twitter.

But wait a minute, isn't Twitter banned in Japan for adults? 

Yes, it is.

Twitter has repeatedly been criticized in Japan for not taking down nude images and has even been accused of promoting child pornography. 

Not only that, Japanese Twitter is also riddled with accounts for prostitution and other illegal activities involving minors. 

As a result, laws to regulate Twitter use were passed in the Japanese parliament in 2023, making it illegal for adults to use the platform. 

Due to these strong regulations and the extraordinary level of censorship in Japanese social media, accounts promoting legal products such as clothing and cosmetics are also being deleted. 

This has created a highly lucrative gap in the Japanese market that Indian Twitter influencers have jumped at, resulting in huge demand for their services from Japanese brands.

## 📝 What kinds of products are Japanese brands asking Indian Twitter influencers to promote?

The types of products that Indian Twitter influencers are being asked to promote by Japanese brands are quite surprising.

According to Aarthi, a popular Indian Twitter influencer with over sixty-eight thousand followers, she has promoted two major brands so far: 

A major Japanese sex toy company specializing in VR-enabled products and a well-known maker of high-end male masturbators.

Yes, you heard it right. 

Japanese brands are specifically seeking out Indian Twitter influencers for their promotional campaigns for adult products.

How could one of the world's leading manufacturers of adult toys possibly overlook Japanese outreach? 

It appears they just assume that their own country's social media sites will do the trick. 

But unfortunately, that's not the case anymore. 

## 💡 How do Indian Twitter influencers find brand deals in Japan?

According to Aarthi, Indian Twitter influencers are being contacted directly by representatives of Japanese brands. 

But how did the representatives of these brands come to know about Indian Twitter influencers in the first place? 

Aarthi has confirmed that Japanese companies have been using Google to find "trusted" Indian Twitter influencers to promote their products. 

Influencer marketing platform BaoLiba also confirms that they have been working with many Indian Twitter influencers for Japanese brands and that Japanese companies are increasingly using Google to identify and contact them. 

Interestingly, BaoLiba specializes in arranging influencer collaborations specifically for adult brands. 

Their data also shows that adult brands from Japan are among their top clients. 

Clearly, being banned helps!

## ❗ What are the payment terms for Indian Twitter influencers promoting Japanese brands?

The payment terms for Indian Twitter influencers promoting Japanese brands are surprisingly generous. 

According to Aarthi, Japanese companies have been paying her ten times the amount that brands in India usually pay her for promotional content. 

She has not provided any exact figures, but estimates that she is earning around one lakh rupees per post. 

But don't think that it's all sunshine and roses for Indian Twitter influencers promoting Japanese brands. 

As with everything in life, there is a catch. 

One catch is that she has to create four posts a day for a particular brand in exchange for the hefty fee. 

And another catch is that payment is always made after the promotional posts are made. 

## 💰 What are the payment methods used to compensate Indian Twitter influencers promoting Japanese brands?

Both Aarthi and BaoLiba confirm that payments for Indian Twitter influencers promoting Japanese brands are made using Bitcoin. 

They claim that using Bitcoin for payments is imperative. 

This is because most payment gateways used to pay influencers, such as PayPal, India and Japan are blocked from using them. 

However, using Bitcoin to make payments also raises a red flag. 

Payments made via Bitcoin are nearly impossible to trace. 

This causes a lot of difficulties for these influencers when it comes to tax time. 

Aarthi says that although she wants to pay taxes on her income, it is quite difficult for her to do so because only she knows how much she was paid in Bitcoin.

And it's not just the said influencer.  

All influencers should take care of their own taxes, and not rely on unaudited and unregulated payment processing companies to do so.  

They could easily find themselves in a severe tax event if their tax authorities caught up with their offshore operations.  

## 📞 How can Indian Twitter influencers get in touch with Japanese brands?

Indian Twitter influencers wanting to reach out to Japanese brands should use Japanese keywords when searching on Google. 

This is because Japanese consumers prefer Japanese-language websites or pages when searching for products or services. 

Also, Indian Twitter influencers should promote themselves using Japanese keywords in their posts as most Japanese brands search for influencers using these keywords. 

Following are some examples of commonly used Japanese keywords for adult products: 

1. バイブ (vibe)
2. バイブレーター (vibrator)
3. おっぱい (oppai)
4. オナホール (onahoru)
5. ホモ (homo)
6. SM (sado-masochism)
7. 潮吹き (shiofuki, or squirt)
8. セックス (sex)
9. 脱衣所 (datsui-sho, or dressing room)
10. オーラルセックス (oral sex)
11. SMプレイ (sado-masochistic play) 
12. フェラチオ (fellation)
13. スワッピング (swapping)
14. セクサロイド (sexaroid)
15. 飲尿 (urinophilia)
16. 連続絶頂 (renzozetsutcho, or multiple orgasms)
17. 逆アナル (gyakuanaru, or analingus) 
18. いぼ痔 (iboji, or hemorrhoids) 
19. 腋毛 (wakige, or armpit hair) 
20. こっこたん (kokkotan, or chicken breasts)
21. ちんこ (chinko)
22. おまんこ (omanko)

It is also recommended to add words such as する (suru, or 'to do') or ます (masu, a polite verb ending) to many of the above words when posting in order to improve search visibility. 

For example, a tweet with the phrase ちんことおまんこ (chinko to omanko) will appear in searches for both terms. 

## 📢 The future of influencer marketing in India

The trend of Indian Twitter influencers getting brand deals from Japan should serve as an inspiration for other social media influencers in India. 

It shows how unconventional and creative marketing efforts can yield huge dividends. 

As reported by the Times of India, the influencer marketing industry in India is projected to grow to ₹22,000 crores ($2.64 billion) by 2025. 

This means that by 2025, there will be even greater opportunities for influencers to discover, create, and promote their own brands, products, and services, as well as earn money with existing brands. 

It is also likely that more Japanese brands will reach out to Indian Twitter influencers exclusively for promotional posts. 

This is because with the recent decline of Twitter as a major global social media platform, more adult brands will be looking for trusted Twitter influencers to promote their products on the platform.  

And since Indian Twitter influencers have already established themselves as the most sought-after professionals in this regard, they will be the ones the majority of Japanese brands will turn to.
