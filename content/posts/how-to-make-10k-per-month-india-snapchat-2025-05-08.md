Snapchat in India isn‚Äôt just some Gen Z fad anymore. By May 2025, it‚Äôs become a legit platform where influencers and brands can rake in serious money‚Äî‚Çπ10 lakh a year or about 10K USD monthly is doable if you play it smart. Whether you‚Äôre an Indian influencer or a brand wanting to tap into influencer marketing, this guide lays out the practical steps to earn online with Snapchat, tailored for the Indian market‚Äôs quirks.

Let‚Äôs cut the fluff and talk real tactics, payment modes, and legal stuff you gotta keep in mind if you wanna hit that ‚Çπ10 lakh/month mark.

## üì¢ Why Snapchat in India? The Untapped Goldmine

Snapchat‚Äôs Indian user base has been growing steadily, especially in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. While Instagram and YouTube hog the limelight, Snapchat‚Äôs unique format (snaps, stories, AR lenses) offers fresh ways to engage.

Brands like Zomato, Swiggy, and Myntra have started experimenting with Snapchat influencer marketing campaigns to target young Indians who prefer quick, bite-sized content.

Unlike TikTok‚Äôs ban, Snapchat faces fewer restrictions, making it a safer bet for long-term influencer collaborations in India.

## üí° How Indian Influencers Are Earning 10K USD per Month on Snapchat

### 1. Nail Your Niche & Content Style

Snapchat‚Äôs audience loves authenticity. Food bloggers, fitness coaches, local fashionistas, and meme creators are seeing traction.

Take @PriyaSnaps from Mumbai, who as of May 2025 pulls in about ‚Çπ8-10 lakh monthly by mixing daily food snaps, local street food reviews, and sponsored shoutouts from Indian brands like Haldiram‚Äôs and Paper Boat.

### 2. Leverage Influencer Marketing Deals

Brands want Snapchat-exclusive campaigns for fresh reach. You can pitch or join platforms like **BaoLiba** that connect Indian influencers with brands.

Typical deals include paid story shoutouts, custom AR filters branded with logos, or even full-on takeovers during product launches.

Example: In early 2025, **Mamaearth** ran a Snapchat lens campaign with influencers from Delhi & Bangalore, paying up to ‚Çπ1.5 lakh per influencer per campaign.

### 3. Sell Your Own Products or Services

Snapchat‚Äôs swipe-up links make it easy to drive traffic to your own online store or affiliate products. If you run an Etsy store or sell digital courses, Snapchat can be a huge traffic source.

Many Indian creators combine this with WhatsApp Business for quick, local payment collection via UPI apps like Google Pay or PhonePe.

### 4. Use Snapchat Spotlight for Viral Reach + Monetization

Indian creators can submit their videos to Spotlight. Snapchat pays based on view count, engagement, and region.

While not a stable income yet, some creators are making ‚Çπ50K‚Äì‚Çπ1 lakh monthly purely from viral Snaps in India.

## üìä What Indian Brands Should Know Before Jumping into Snapchat Marketing

- **Audience Insight:** Snapchat skews younger and urban but is rapidly spreading to smaller cities.
- **Payment & Contracts:** Most Indian payments happen via bank transfer or UPI. Brands must draft clear influencer contracts respecting Indian IT laws and GST implications.
- **Content Guidelines:** Ensure content complies with India‚Äôs Information Technology Rules to avoid takedown or legal trouble.
- **Metrics to Track:** Focus on views, story completion rate, swipe-up CTR, and direct messages for conversions.

## ‚ùó Legal & Payment Tips for Snapchat Influencer Marketing in India

- Always get **Written Contracts** specifying deliverables, payment terms, and copyright ownership.
- Know your taxes! Indian influencers earning ‚Çπ10K USD/month must register under GST and pay income tax on their proceeds.
- Use **UPI & bank transfers** for smooth, traceable payments. Avoid cash deals to stay transparent.
- Ensure all branded content is clearly tagged as **#Ad** or **#Sponsored** as per Indian advertising standards.

Food, fashion, fitness, meme pages, and local travel content are hot. Brands want influencers who can authentically connect with young Indian audiences in these sectors.

## üí° Final Words: Your 10K Dream Is Just a Snap Away

Snapchat offers a fresh playground for Indian influencers and brands tired of crowded social media. The secret sauce? Be authentic, pick the right niche, and build direct brand ties.
