The digital marketing industry is undergoing rapid expansion. The influencer market has seen phenomenal growth thanks to social media giants like Facebook. 

According to a report by the Indian Influencer Marketing Association, 73% of Indian influencers surveyed earn 50% of their revenue from brand sponsorship, and 44% expect to make more money in 2025.

Among the major social media platforms, India’s influencer marketing budget has skyrocketed, jumping from $75 million in 2020 to a projected $225 million by the end of 2025. Facebook has at least a 60% share of that influencer marketing pie.

Despite Facebook’s growing popularity among Indian influencers, many companies still rely on Instagram and YouTube to establish brand deals in India, missing out on a vast untapped market.

That could soon change. A budding trend has Indian influencers investing their time into targeting Dutch brands for potential sponsorships on Facebook.

Let’s take a look at how Indian influencers are finding brand deals on Facebook and what they expect from Dutch brands.


## 🔎 The Promise of Facebook

Although Facebook has become less popular among most younger generations, it continues to thrive among India’s influencer generation due to its ease of use and the success of other influencers.

“Instagram may have higher engagement rates, but Facebook has a larger and more diverse user base,” said influential Indian digital marketing expert Aryan Khosla. “I believe more Indian influencers will jump ship from Instagram to Facebook in the coming years due to the opportunities that will arise from the new Meta tools.”

Meta, Facebook's parent company, has announced several creator tools that will soon rival Instagram and TikTok, bringing more competition into the influencer space.

Indian influencers are getting hip to the possibilities.

For example, Indian influencers Abbas Sayani and Kaifi Naaz, who specialize in comedy skits, recently told local media that their Facebook skits have become far more profitable than their previous brand deals on Instagram.

“On Facebook, a sponsored skit can earn anywhere from INR 50,000 to INR 200,000,” said Naaz. “On Instagram, we were lucky to get INR 2,500 for a shoutout.”


## 💰 Dutch Brands Are Ready to Go!

Dutch brands are noticeably less engaged with Indian influencers because they come from different cultures and cannot relate to their audience.

“The Netherlands is somewhat of a melting pot of different cultures,” said Dutch marketing expert Dries Vreugdenhil. “It’s not uncommon to see influencer campaigns target people who are not even located in that country, as long as they can potentially connect with Dutch consumers through a relevant lens.”

Vreugdenhil also stated that Dutch brands are considerably more receptive to sponsored content than brands from other countries because they possess more corporate responsibility.

“Many countries still see influencer marketing as a gimmick, but that is changing,” he remarked. “In the Netherlands, it is increasingly being seen as a responsible marketing practice, and that opens the door for influencer campaigns to be more inclusive of foreign influencers.”


## 📊 The Lowdown on Dutch Brands

Many Dutch brands have already expressed their willingness to collaborate with Indian influencers on Meta platforms like Facebook and Instagram.

Dutch marketing guru Mariska van Tiel says that the same economical woes that have shaken cherish podcasts have also affected many Dutch companies' operations, prompting them to search abroad for untapped marketing avenues.

“Many of our traditional marketing tools just aren’t working like they used to due to inflation,” she noted. “Just like radio stations are resorting to podcasts to reach audiences, many Dutch businesses are looking towards foreign influencers to get their message across.”

Van Tiel also identified the growing importance of diversity in the influencer marketing space.

Diversity is a growing priority for customers across industries, even in the Netherlands, and many companies are turning to Indian influencers to stake their claim for inclusion in the influencer arena.

“Indian influencers will help inject some much-needed diversity into Dutch marketing campaigns,” said van Tiel.


## 🤝 Influencers Get Ready!

Many Indian influencers are asserting that it is high time for influencers to stand up and showcase their skills to interested Dutch brands. 

With the Dutch economy reaching record highs and Indian influencers experiencing recently heightened brand deals, Indian influencers should take the hint and pitch Dutch brands on Meta’s Facebook.

Popular Indian content creator Shweta Mehta offered this advice to influencers looking to pitch their services to Dutch brands.

“As simple as it sounds, pitching is an art that requires practice,” she stated. “The more you pitch, and the more you refine your pitches, the better you will get at it.”

Mehta also suggested that influencers learn how to create effective social media bios.

“Your bio is essentially your digital business card. It should highlight your unique selling proposition and contain a compelling call to action.”

In addition, they should also keep track of their metrics.

“Brands want to see cold hard evidence that you have a loyal following that regularly engages with your content,” warned Mehta.


## 💡 Learning the Ropes

Choosing the right pitching channels can also make or break an influencer’s potential deal with a Dutch brand.

While many influencers are already familiar with pitching their services through email or social media direct messages, they should check out some of the lesser-known yet effective pitching channels.

For example, Facebook groups that cater to influencer marketing can be a very effective way to connect brands and influencers looking to work together.

The following Facebook groups are prime candidates for influencers who want to gain the attention of Dutch brands.

- **Influencer Marketing Hub & Network** - This group is dedicated to influencer marketing and has become home to many brands looking for social media influencers. Many influencers have reported successful collaborations through this group.

- **Social Media Influencer Group** - As the name suggests, this group caters to influencers located in various regions, making it a prime landing group for brands looking for influencers from different parts of the world.

- **Social Media & Influencer Marketing** - This group serves as a community for social media marketers and influencers to connect. It has already been established as a go-to resource for brands searching for influencers.


## 🚀 Get Involved!

Influencers can also enroll in influencer programs that guide them through the pitching process while providing insider knowledge along the way.

Here is a sample of influencer programs that cater to influencers looking to pitch their services to Dutch brands.

- **Influencer Academy** - The Influencer Academy offers many courses designed to help influencers establish their presence, build a following, and attract brands, including Dutch brands.

- **Collabor8** - This app allows influencers and brands to connect and collaborate. They guide influencers through the process of pitching their services to brands, as well as all of the details after a successful pitch. 

- **Influencer Marketing Strategy Community** - This community is dedicated to influencer marketing insights that will help influencers grow their influence and attract brands from every corner of the globe.


## ❗ Things to Keep in Mind

While influencers can potentially work with any brands, they must remember to select brands that align with their core values so they can remain authentic.

“Influencers must take great care in selecting brands or products to promote,” cautioned Indian influencer marketing expert Manoj Kumar. “It is easy to chase the money and overlook what is best for your brand and your audience.”

Promoting products that do not align with a creator’s values will confuse their audience and muddle their personal brand. 

For example, an Indian vegan influencer who suddenly promotes a meat product will likely lose significant respect and credibility.

On the other hand, influencers who retain their integrity by focusing on relevant brands and products will build a dedicated community of loyal followers.


## 📢 Stay Tuned!

With Dutch brands getting ready to take advantage of new marketing opportunities, Indian influencers must prepare themselves to assist Dutch brands in reaching their goals.

Meta should also do their part by promoting Indian influencers, who are traditionally overlooked by major Dutch companies, as the influencers of choice—especially on Facebook.

The future of influencer marketing depends heavily on the impressions of its creators. 

Let’s hope that Meta—and all other social media platforms—continue to invest in their creators so that they can meaningfully connect with their audience and bring value to the brands that sponsor them.

Meta is introducing new tools in 2023 that will make it easier to reward creators directly on apps like Facebook and Instagram.

Although Dutch brands will inevitably take notice of Indian influencers pitching their services on Facebook, they will also notice Dutch influencers who don’t have the same competencies as Indian influencers, which can potentially lead to a shift in the influencer marketing landscape.
