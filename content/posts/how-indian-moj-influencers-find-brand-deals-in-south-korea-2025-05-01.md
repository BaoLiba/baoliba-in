In addition to South Korea, Moj is also available in other countries like Japan, the United States, Canada, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, and the UK.

- **How Korean Businesses are Using Moj**: Korean businesses have already begun to use Moj for their marketing campaigns.

Moj recently partnered with the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) to promote the K-Kessy Festival, which celebrates Korean culture.

## üíá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How Indian Influencers are Getting Brand Deals in Korea?

Indian Moj influencers are getting brand deals in Korea through their managers who are based in Korea.

These managers negotiate contracts with Korean companies on behalf of the influencers, ensuring that they get fair compensation for their work. 

These managers also help the influencers with their travel and accommodation arrangements when they travel to Korea for work. 

Some Indian influencers have even set up their agencies to help their fellow influencers gain fame and get brand deals in Korea.

Moj has gained immense popularity in Korea and many Korean influencers are now joining Moj to take their fame to the next level.

Various international brands are now collaborating with both Indian and Korean influencers to promote their products.

To make this possible, Indian influencers need to be flexible and adapt to the local culture when working in foreign countries.

For example, Indian influencer Manisha Rathi, who is known for her dance videos, wore a traditional Hanbok dress in a recent video to connect with the Korean audience. 

- **Influencers are Traveling to Korea for Work**: Indian influencers are now visiting Korea for work, and this is a big boost for their careers.

The Korean beauty brand O HUI recently invited 9 Indian Moj influencers to Korea to promote their products. 

These influencers created content around their products, which increased the brand‚Äôs visibility in India. 

The influencers also enjoyed various activities in Korea and learned how to use the products they were promoting.

Another Indian influencer, Shivam Sinha, received a warm welcome at the Incheon International Airport from fans and the Korean media. 

He was invited to Korea for a week-long media tour organized by the Korean Film Commission. 

During his visit, he learned the various aspects of Korean cinema and how to create short films. 

The event was a great success as it was covered by many media outlets in India.


## üë©‚Äçüíº Are Korean Brands Paying Indian Influencers in Rupees or Won?

Korean brands are paying Indian Moj influencers in Rupees.

However, the amount they receive is much lower than the amounts Korean influencers receive. 

For example, Indian influencers are being paid between 50,000 and 100,000 Rupees for brand collaborations. 

In contrast, Korean influencers are paid between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Won. 

This means that Indian influencers are being paid 25% of what their Korean counterparts are being paid.

A senior manager at a Korean beauty brand stated that Indian influencers are not as established in Korea yet and that is why they are being paid less.

But it won‚Äôt be long before they start charging more. 

After all, it is their fame and influence that is helping Korean brands gain traction in India.
