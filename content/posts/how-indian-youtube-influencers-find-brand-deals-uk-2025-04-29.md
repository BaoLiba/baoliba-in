Most Indian YouTube influencers are agog about brand deals with UK companies. They have it in their mind that brand deals with UK companies will make them popular in India and bring about a higher quality of collaborations with Indian brands. 

UK brand deals are touted as the golden goose among Indian YouTubers. They believe that only YouTubers who have made a name for themselves in India can get brand deals in the UK. 

This is a misconception. Indian YouTubers do not need to be famous in India to get brand deals with UK companies. They do not need a huge subscriber base. They do not even need to be known in India as YouTubers. 

Indeed, many of the Indian YouTube influencers who are landing brand deals with UK companies do not even reside in India. These Indian influencers are based in India, Singapore, and Dubai, among other countries.
