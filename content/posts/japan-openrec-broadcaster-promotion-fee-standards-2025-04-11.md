## üìä What Determines an Openrec Influencer‚Äôs Rates?

While there are standard rates for collaborating with Openrec influencers in Japan, the pricing can vary depending on several factors. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what influences an influencer‚Äôs rates.

### 1. Influencer‚Äôs Audience Size

Just like other influencers, the bigger the audience and following, the more an influencer can charge.

Openrec influencers are known for their niche audiences, and many of them have around 10,000 to 30,000 regular viewers per month.

In comparison, mainstream influencers on other platforms boast followers in the hundreds of thousands to millions.

As such, Openrec influencers tend to charge less, but still maintain a loyal fanbase. Brands can benefit from a more engaged audience.

### 2. Type of Content Offered

Openrec influencers offer various types of promotional content, which can influence their pricing.

Some influencers may offer a full-paid stream, where they dedicate a portion of their show to your brand, while others may provide a sponsored post.


Other examples of popular collaboration options include:

- Hosting an amped-up tournament with your brand sponsorship.
- Providing exclusive membership rates that feature your brand‚Äôs products or services.


Typically, more interactive services will cost more, whereas a simple mention of your brand or product in a stream will be cheaper.


### 3. Influencer‚Äôs Experience & Skills

Aside from audience size, an influencer‚Äôs reputation and experience can greatly impact their rate.

Influencers known for exceptional quality in their work, unique personalities, or expertise in their chosen niche can charge a premium.

Likewise, more experienced influencers who have a solid track record of successful brand collaborations can also command higher fees.

### 4. Type of Video Game Played

The type of video games an influencer plays can also affect pricing.

Openrec influencers playing mainstream and popular games tend to charge higher prices. These games typically have a bigger following, which results in higher viewer counts.

In contrast, influencers playing smaller or niche games might charge lower rates, but could provide more dedicated engagement from their audience.

### 5. Time Consumed Delivering Services

Some services can require more time than others.

For example, a paid stream may only require one or two hours for delivery, while a sponsorship for exclusive membership rates might require weeks of promotion.

As such, influencers can charge more for services that require a longer commitment or more effort to produce.

### 6. Brand Reputation

Lastly, an influencer‚Äôs pricing may depend on the reputation of your brand.

If you‚Äôre a well-known brand, it‚Äôs possible that an influencer will charge higher rates. Alternatively, if you‚Äôre a small or new company, you may be able to negotiate lower prices.

Generally, reputable brands are preferred because influencers typically want to align themselves with companies that are respected and known for quality.

## ü§ù How to Collaborate with Openrec Influencers

Collaborating with Openrec influencers follows a similar process as other platforms. Here's how it typically works.

### Step 1: Find Suitable Influencers

Use influencer marketing platforms to search for influencers that match your brand‚Äôs needs based on various filters.

Beyond pricing, search based on categories or interests, reach, engagement, and more.

### Step 2: Reach Out

Once you‚Äôve found the right influencers, reach out directly through their Openrec profiles or social media channels.

Make sure to provide details about your brand and the type of collaboration you‚Äôre interested in.

### Step 3: Confirm the Details

Negotiate terms with the influencer, including the collaboration type, pricing, timeline, expectations, and deliverables.

Make sure to confirm all the details in writing before moving forward, specifying how and when the influencer will promote your brand.

### Step 4: Payment

Once the details are confirmed, proceed with payment. There are various methods to go about this, including cryptocurrency.

Ensure you have clarity on payment terms to avoid any misunderstandings.

## ‚ùó Is Hiring Openrec Influencers Worth It?
