Indian YouTubers are increasingly catching the attention of Japanese brands and companies looking to promote their products. While still in its infancy, this trend is gaining traction among companies seeking better returns on their marketing investments through collaborations with influencers in India.

Although the Japanese influencer marketing landscape is mainly centered on domestic talents, the greater global reach of Indian influencers through YouTube has opened the door for Japanese companies to explore the potential of cross-border promotions.

## ü§î Why Indian YouTubers?

India is home to one of the most vibrant and expansive YouTube communities, boasting 500 million active monthly users and over 30 million channels. This expansive reach has attracted the attention of brands and product companies across Asia, especially in Japan, which is renowned for its robust economy and dedication to innovative product development.

Despite the language barrier, Indian YouTubers are able to promote products effectively, using subtitles, English, or a combination of both in their videos. Particularly in Japan, where the average Joe is less likely to know English than in other countries, using Indian influencers who speak English can effectively drive sales.

In addition, brands and companies in Japan can enjoy lower investments and better ROIs through collaborations with Indian influencers on YouTube. Paid collaborations with Indian influencers cost 30%-50% less than their Japanese counterparts, meaning Japanese companies have more wiggle room for longer campaigns.

## üí∞ Payment Methods

Bank transfers are the most popular payment method for Indian YouTube influencers when doing brand collaborations. However, this conventional payment method comes with its drawbacks. Bank transfers can take several days to complete and may also be subject to high fees and unfavorable exchange rates. Moreover, international transfers from Japan to India may sometimes be hampered by various regulations that slow down payment processing.

To facilitate payments for brand collaborations with Indian influencers, Japanese companies can utilize payment apps specific to India like Paytm and PhonePe. Alternatively, they can also make outbound transfers using global payment platforms like PayPal, Stripe, and TransferWise.

In addition, Japanese companies making wholesale purchases of products from India can utilize services such as Payoneer that facilitate easy cross-border payments.

## ‚úàÔ∏è Visa and Travel plans

Brand promotions and collaborations through YouTube often require influencers to travel for product experiences or demonstrations. For Indian influencers looking to secure brand deals in Japan, having a travel plan is essential.

Japan offers three types of visas for Indian travelers, namely the tourist visa, business visa, and work visa. However, for Indian YouTubers offering brand promotion services to Japanese companies, the business visa is the ideal choice, allowing them to travel and conduct business activities over extended periods of time.

Obtaining a business visa for Japan may require a considerable amount of documentation and patience. Although the processing time can take anywhere from several weeks to several months, Indian influencers can secure their business visas through the following general steps:

- Prepare Application Documents: Indian influencers must gather all required documents for their business visa application, including a valid passport, visa application form, photographs, proof of business activities, itinerary, and other supporting documents.
- Find a Sponsor: Indian influencers must find a Japanese company or organization to sponsor their visa application. The sponsor can help facilitate the visa process and provide necessary documentation.
- Submit Application: Indian influencers must submit their visa application and all required documents to the nearest Japanese embassy or consulate in India.
- Attend Interview (if applicable): In some cases, Indian influencers may be required to attend an interview at the Japanese embassy or consulate.
- Wait for Processing: The visa processing time can take 3 days to several weeks. Indian influencers should be patient and follow up with the embassy or consulate for updates.
- Receive Visa: If approved, Indian influencers will receive their Japanese business visa. They can then make travel arrangements to Japan.

## üé¨ Film and Content Regulations

Japan is known for its strict laws and regulations, especially regarding filming in public places and using personal cameras for commercial purposes. When creating brand promotional content in public places, Indian YouTubers must respect these laws and regulations, otherwise they risk running afoul of the law.

To avoid legal issues while filming in Japan, Indian influencers should consider the following tips:

- Understand Japanese Laws: Familiarize themselves with Japan's laws and regulations regarding filming. Research any specific requirements that may apply to the type of content Indian influencers will create.
- Seek Permission: If filming in a public space like a park or street, it is advisable to get permission from relevant authorities. Indian influencers may need to obtain permits for certain activities or locations, especially if large crowds will be involved.
- Respect Privacy: Respect the privacy of individuals while filming in public. Avoid capturing identifiable images of people without their consent, especially if the content is for commercial purposes.
- Use Appropriate Equipment: Use equipment that complies with local regulations. For example, if using drones for aerial shots, ensure they meet Japan's drone regulations and that necessary permits are obtained.
- Plan Ahead: Plan filming locations and activities in advance, allowing time to secure any necessary permits or permissions. Being proactive can help avoid legal problems later on.
- Consult Local Experts: Consider working with a local production company or legal expert familiar with Japanese regulations. They can help navigate the regulatory landscape and ensure compliance with local laws.

## üì± Social Media Landscape

In terms of social media, India and Japan share several common platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and TikTok. However, Japan is home to several unique platforms which, despite having smaller adoption rates in their domestic market, are widely used by consumers and businesses abroad.

When expanding their scope beyond domestic shores, Indian YouTubers can leverage these platforms to promote their services to Japanese companies looking for influencers to collaborate with.

For instance, JATV is a Japanese talent agency that connects influencers with businesses looking for advertising partners. The company is notable for being a pioneer of YouTube influencer marketing in Japan, targeting the Japanese market through its network of over ten thousand influencers.

JATV features a talent ranking system that showcases influencer profiles tailored to the needs of both brands and companies. Indian YouTube influencers looking to establish their presence in the Japanese market can register their profiles on JATV, thereby increasing their visibility for potential brand deals.

Another platform is 310X, which is a marketing agency specializing in cross-border influencer marketing. Brands looking to promote their products in Japan can partner with 310X to reach audiences through local influencers or collaborate with foreign influencers to expand their global reach.

310X connects Japanese companies with foreign influencers on YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. Indian YouTube influencers looking to secure brand deals in Japan can easily register their profiles on the 310X platform, giving them access to a greater pool of potential collaborations.

Lastly, Yuuta is a marketing platform that specializes in connecting influencers with Japanese brands seeking promotion through social media. The Yuuta platform allows Indian YouTube influencers to showcase their profiles and reach out to Japanese brands for collaboration opportunities.

## üìä Profitable Product Categories

The Indian YouTube community is multifaceted, with creators specializing in a wide range of categories from music, gaming, food, tech, fitness, fashion, and travel. Among these verticals, numerous categories can align with the needs of Japanese brands seeking promotion through Indian influencers.

One of the most lucrative product categories for Indian YouTube influencers collaborating with Japanese brands is eCommerce. India is already one of the fastest-growing eCommerce markets in the world, with mobile commerce leading the charge, growing 20% year-on-year.

Japanese brands looking to make inroads into India can leverage the reach of Indian YouTube influencers to promote their offerings and drive sales in the region. Already, several leading Japanese brands are leveraging Indian influencers to promote their products in India.

For example, Zojirushi, a Japanese manufacturer of vacuum flasks and thermal insulation, has successfully partnered with Indian YouTubers as part of its marketing strategy to promote its products in India.

## üì¢ Market Trends

Looking ahead, the collaboration trend between Indian YouTube influencers and Japanese brands is expected to gain momentum over the next two years as more influencers tap into this burgeoning market.

According to JETRO, the Japan External Trade Organization, the influencer marketing industry in Japan is estimated to be worth 40 billion yen (approximately $274 million) in 2025. Furthermore, the organization estimates that collaborations between foreign influencers and Japanese companies will account for 16% of that market, translating to 6.4 billion yen or $44 million.

Among foreign influencers, Indian YouTubers are likely to dominate this nascent segment of the influencer marketing industry in Japan. Thanks to their established reputation and experience as influencers, Indian YouTubers are well-positioned to capture the lion‚Äôs share of this segment, outpacing influencers from other countries. 

Earlier in 2022, Japan was also ranked among the top export destinations for Indian influencers, highlighted by 60% of Indian respondents indicating that they tapped into the Japanese market for brand deals.

## ‚ùó Conclusion

As the trend of Indian YouTube influencers securing brand deals in Japan gains momentum, it is essential for both influencers and Japanese companies to navigate the unique landscape effectively.

By understanding payment methods, visa requirements, filming regulations, and opportunities through social media platforms, Indian influencers can thrive in this growing market niche. Simultaneously, Japanese companies can tap into this vibrant community to promote their products and extend their market reach.

As this space continues to evolve, staying informed about the latest trends, regulations, and opportunities will be crucial for sustained success in the cross-border influencer marketing landscape between India and Japan.
