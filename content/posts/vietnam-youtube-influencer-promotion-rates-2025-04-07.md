In Vietnam, YouTube influencer marketing is booming. However, the costs of collaboration can be hard to pin down. 

Vietnamese YouTube influencers vary immensely in pricing based on a wide range of factors, including their follower count, view rates, and even the amount of time your ad will be shown. 

## üíª How to find Vietnamese YouTube influencers

It‚Äôs important to take time to think about which YouTube influencers you want to work with. 

Think about the influencer's audience; do they fit your target demographic? Also, consider their content; is there a good fit for your brand? 

To find the right fit, Vietnamese brands, like those in India, often use influencer marketing platforms. 

Influencer marketing platforms typically have filters to narrow down which influencers fit your needs. 

Some examples of influencer marketing platforms in Vietnam include:

- Buzzmetrics
- Tiktokz
- Ohana

## üìà Pricing overview

According to a report by VietnamNet, campaigns with Vietnamese YouTube influencers can cost anywhere from $500 to $20,000. 

Brands want to reach the biggest audience possible for the lowest price. Luckily, the report also states that Vietnamese YouTube influencers are willing to negotiate on their rates. 

Vietnamese influencers charge less than influencers from many Western countries. 

Prices can vary widely from influencer to influencer, and even the same influencer may charge different rates for different brands. 

Brands can expect to pay about $500 to $2,000 for a video ad featuring a product mention. 

For shoutouts, prices can reach $10,000 or more. 

Even prices for non-YouTube influencers can vary widely. 

In a 2025 Buzzmetrics report, brands should expect to pay between $500 and $1000 for an influencer marketing post on Vietnamese Facebook and TikTok. 

## üì© Pricing breakdown

Vietnamese YouTube influencers base their pricing on several metrics that affect the cost of collaboration. 

### üìú Follower count

The most common way to categorize influencers is by the size of their audience; follower count. 

Generally speaking, more followers means a higher rate. Most brands can expect to pay around: 

- 100,000 followers: $500
- 500,000 followers: $2,500
- 1 million followers: $5,000

### üìä View count

More important than follower count is how many views each video gets. 

Many followers don‚Äôt equal many views. Some influencers may have millions of followers but only get a few thousand views per video. 

Most brands can expect to pay around:

- 10,000 views: $500
- 50,000 views: $2,500
- 100,000 views: $5,000

### ‚è≥ Ad time

Many influencers offer different rates based on how much of the video is dedicated to the brand's promotion. 

For example, if a brand wants a mention at the beginning, middle, and end of a five-minute video, that could cost more than a mention in only the middle. 

Base price for a mention:

- 15 seconds: $500
- 30 seconds: $2,500
- 60 seconds: $5,000

### üé≠ Type of promotion

There are other factors that can affect the price of collaboration, such as: 

- Type of product: Speaking fees usually go up for luxury brands. 
- Type of promotion: A sponsored video costs more than a simple mention. 

## üí≥ Payment options

Most Vietnamese influencers want payment upfront, especially if they have a large follower count. 

Usually, brands will discuss the details over email, and then pay via bank transfer to the influencer‚Äôs business account. 

Some influencers have e-wallets or use services like Paypal and Western Union. 

Influencers may also use cryptocurrency. However, Vietnam‚Äôs cryptocurrency laws are murky and brands should be careful to avoid scams. 

## üí° Bottom line 

In Vietnam, YouTube influencer marketing prices can range from a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands of dollars. 

Influencers base pricing on several metrics such as follower count, number of views, ad time, type of promotion, and type of product. 

Brands should expect to pay most Vietnamese YouTube influencers upfront.
