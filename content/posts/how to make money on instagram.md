In the world of influencer marketing, there are always two sides to the story. One side is the influencer or the brand or the agency representing the influencer. The other side is the audience, consumers or followers of the influencer. Between them both, there is also a third party and that is the product or service being marketed.

While the influencer, brand, agency, and audience have to ensure that they are doing their due diligence and not putting out fake stories, sometimes they themselves have been victims of frauds. This is particularly true for influencers who are supposed to be marketing products and services.

An influencer is not a logistics expert and cannot be expected to know where the product comes from and how it has been made, packaged or the quality of what is being sold. All they know is what they are told by the brand or agency or what they read in the brochure or website. If the influencer is told that they are selling authentic products, they will go ahead and say that in their marketing post or video. And when the audience buys the product based on what the influencer has said, they will be disappointed.

As a brand looking for influencers to help market your product or service, you have to put yourself in the shoes of the influencer and imagine what they are going through. 

A recent news report says that a group of Indian influencers fell prey to fake luxury products and fake marketplaces. Over a dozen influencers had been invited by a company called Luxxy, which is based in Dubai, to a launch event in Mumbai, India.

The influencers were told that they would get luxury items as gifts for attending the event. Among the gifts were luxury watches and perfumes claimed to be worth thousands of dollars each. The influencers were flattered and thrilled to receive such high-end products and said they would market the products in their posts.

However, when the influencers went to the website of Luxxy or searched for it online, they could not find any information about it. In fact, the only information they found was that Luxxy was a fake company that had defrauded both the influencers and the audience who bought the products.  

The influencers soon learned that the products they had received were all fake and worth a pittance compared to what they were told. They also learned that they had been used as unwitting dupes in a scam to sell fake luxury items to consumers. 

To add insult to injury, the influencer who was the most vocal about the products being real and who had marketed them the most ended up receiving a fake version of the fake luxury items. 

Fake companies and fake influencers are a dime a dozen. Brands need to be careful of who they are getting into business with and what promises they are making. 

According to a report by the global influencer marketing agency, The Untold, out of 300 Indian influencers surveyed, 64% of them admitted to having received fake products from brands and agencies. 
And among them, 76% of the influencers said they had no way of knowing that the products were fake until they were received and confirmed as such. 

Brands and agencies were known to send fake products to influencers and expect them to market them as real.  And when consumers bought the products based on the influencer's recommendation, they found the products were fake and worth only a fraction compared to what they had paid.

Sometimes the influencers themselves had been victims of fake products and they had no idea that they were marketing fakes. 

According to 63.5% of the influencers surveyed, they had marketed fake products without knowing they were fake. 

So if you are a brand looking for influencers to market your product, you have to ensure that you are sending only real and authentic products to the influencers. 

It is not enough to say that you are selling authentic products. You have to prove it by sending the real products to the influencers so that they can show their audience that they are indeed real. 

Otherwise, you will end up turning your influencers into victims of counterfeit products and victims of frauds yourself.
