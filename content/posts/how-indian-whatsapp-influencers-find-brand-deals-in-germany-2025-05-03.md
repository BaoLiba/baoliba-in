In the last two years, WhatsApp influencer marketing has evolved into a phenomenon in India. The rise of WhatsApp influencers is driven by the platform's popularity, easy accessibility, and the ability to reach out to a large number of people simultaneously. 

According to a survey by the KPMG, WhatsApp is the preferred platform for social media interactions in India, with 77% of respondents using it regularly. 

This success has led influencers to begin securing brand deals through WhatsApp groups, and now some are taking their talents abroad. 

In fact, Indian influencers are now traveling internationally for these WhatsApp influencer brand deals, and Germany is fast becoming a popular destination.

### üèôÔ∏è WhatsApp Influencers in Germany

Although WhatsApp influencer marketing has become a goldmine back home, German brands are now actively courting Indian influencers to help them secure a foothold in the Indian market. 

Eager to secure their services, these brands are hosting Indian influencers in Germany and showering them with extravagant gifts as a way to entice them to work with their brands.

A recent report by the Times of India indicates that this trend has grown exponentially in Germany and that German brands are now pouring millions of rupees into these campaigns.

The report also suggests that this trend is likely to grow in the coming years as more brands recognize the effectiveness of WhatsApp influencers in penetrating the Indian market.

### üí∏ Cashing In on WhatsApp Influencing

In a recent interview with the Times of India, WhatsApp influencer and industry insider Manish Singh shared his experience of working with a German influencer marketing agency that focuses solely on WhatsApp influencers.

According to Singh, WhatsApp influencers based in India can earn anywhere from ‚Ç¨2,000 to ‚Ç¨15,000 for a single campaign in Germany. 

Singh explained that the fees depend on the influencer‚Äôs market value and the extent of the campaign, with larger campaigns commanding a higher fee. 

Typically, these campaigns comprise product placement posts on WhatsApp groups and, in some cases, promotional posts on their social media profiles. 

German brands are also covering the travel costs of these influencers, including flights and accommodation, as well as providing them with extravagant gifts like luxury watches, handbags, and expensive perfumes.

Singh's agency reportedly received over 100 requests from German brands in December 2023 alone.

### ‚ùó Why German Brands Prefer Indian WhatsApp Influencers?

The growing popularity of Indian WhatsApp influencers in Germany can be attributed to the fact that a large portion of the Indian diaspora resides in Germany. 

According to the German Federal Statistical Office, approximately 178,000 Indians were living in Germany as of January 2023, making them one of the largest immigrant groups in the country. 

This has led to an increase in demand for Indian products and services, particularly in the areas of food, fashion, and culture.

As a result, German brands are recognizing that reaching out to Indian WhatsApp influencers can be an effective way to tap into this growing market. 

Indian WhatsApp influencers boast millions of followers, with some having over 15 million followers across their channels. 

This allows them to reach more people than traditional social media influencers, thereby maximizing their marketing impact.

### üì≤ WhatsApp Influencer Marketing Agencies in India

As is typical of any burgeoning industry, WhatsApp influencer marketing agencies have sprung up across India. 

These agencies connect brands with WhatsApp influencers and handle the logistics of their campaigns, particularly those that involve travel. 

LimeLight, which is one of the leading WhatsApp influencer marketing agencies in India, reported that they completed over 1,200 campaigns with Indian WhatsApp influencers for German brands in 2023, which represents a 200% growth from the previous year.

The agency specializes in WhatsApp influencer marketing and was among the first agencies to do so in the Indian market.

According to Ashish Choudhary, the CEO of LimeLight, one of the reasons for this growth is that people often ignore promotional messages on their social media feeds. 

However, they usually pay attention to WhatsApp messages since the platform is more personal. 

‚ÄúUnlike others, WhatsApp influencer marketing helps deliver the brand‚Äôs message directly to the audience rather than just reaching them. That's why they are gaining traction among marketers in Germany,‚Äù Choudhary told the Times of India.

   - Legitimate groups will provide specific information about the skills and qualifications they are looking for in influencers. 

5. **Poor Grammar and Spelling**
