In the increasingly competitive world of Indian social media, marketers are continually exploring fresh mediums for their influencer marketing efforts. One platform that has been generating buzz lately for its young and energetic audience is Twitcasting. 

Marketers who are eyeing this platform for influencer marketing campaigns frequently approach us for clarity on the pricing standards for influencers on Twitcasting. 

If you are also seeking this information, we have it for you today in this article. Keep reading to check out the rates for India-based Twitcasting influencers.


## üì¢ What Is Twitcasting?

Twitcasting is a live-streaming platform that has been climbing the charts in Japan for some time. It has gone beyond the confines of the Japanese market and is steadily establishing itself as a global phenomenon. 

In India, Twitcasting is particularly garnering attention in the youth-oriented crowd. 

The Japan-based app allows users to broadcast live streaming videos whenever they want and share them with followers almost instantly. 

Being a Japanese application, it has a distinct interface and features, which differentiates it from mainstream social media platforms.

Another unique aspect of Twitcasting is that it is primarily for mobile devices, which is consistent with the high usage of smartphones among the youth in India.

The app allows users to stream casual videos such as karaoke performances, playing video games, training pets, or simply chatting with friends.


## üí° What Are the Rates for Influencers on Twitcasting in India?

Most marketers and brands exploring influencer marketing campaigns on Twitcasting are surprised to learn that influencer rates on Twitcasting are higher than those of many popular social media platforms among the Indian youth.

The reason for this price point is the lack of competition in the Twitcasting influencer marketing space in India. 

Indo-Japanese influencers with a good following often charge more than the typical influencer rates on Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and other mainstream platforms.

Currently, most influencers on Twitcasting charge around ‚Çπ8000 for a sponsored live stream of an hour. 

Influencers with a following of more than 50,000 on Twitcasting can charge anything from ‚Çπ10,000 to ‚Çπ15,000 for the same duration.


## üìä How Many Brands Are Using Twitcasting Influencers?

With the growing popularity of Twitcasting among the Indian youth, many Japanese brands are actively utilizing Twitcasting influencers for their marketing needs in India.

For instance, the locally popular ramen chain, Ippudo, has collaborated with Twitcasting influencers multiple times to promote its ramen among Indian patrons.

Since Indian users cannot access Japanese Twitcasting influencers, Indian brands must use local talent only when they want to promote their offerings on the application. 


## ‚ùó Why Are the Rates So Low on Twitcasting? 

While influencer rates on Twitcasting are quite high compared to the Indian influencer marketing landscape, they still appear quite low to marketers who are used to paying high rates to influencers on more popular platforms.

To explain this disparity, we have listed a few reasons below:

1. **Lack of Competition**: Since Twitcasting is still a nascent application in the Indian influencer marketing space, only a handful of influencers with decent following are available for collaboration, which means they can afford to charge comparatively low rates.

2. **More Engagement**: Influencers on Twitcasting routinely attract and engage their audience in real-time conversations and entertainment, which means their followers are extremely involved with their content.

Twitch, a popular live-streaming platform that is often regarded as a competitor for Twitscasting, boasts similar levels of influencer engagement. 

3. **Visual Medium**: Unlike platforms such as blogs and Twitter where text dominates the content, Twitcasting is a highly visual medium, which means influencers have to invest more time and effort to create quality content, leading to a lower overall rate per influencer hour.


## üì¢ What Are the Payment Methods Used by Influencers on Twitcasting?

Payment methods are crucial in influencer marketing campaigns, especially in cross-border efforts where international payments often create hurdles for brands.

We often get asked about the payment methods that influencers on Twitcasting prefer.

Since Twitcasting is a Japanese app, influencers on it prefer to receive payments via Japanese payment methods. Common methods of payment used by Twitcasting influencers in India include:

1. **Paypal**: Highly preferred for international payments, we have seen many Indian influencers use Paypal to receive influencer marketing payments.

2. **Wise**: Wise is another popular payment method used by influencers on Twitcasting to receive payments in Japanese yen.
 
3. **Western Union**: This method of payment is particularly popular among local Indian influencers since it is widely accessible.
