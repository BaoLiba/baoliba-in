Did you know that over 1.3 billion people use ShareChat? The Indian social media platform is booming in India, but it has also struck gold overseas.


Forget TikTok! Influencers from ShareChat have started to infiltrate Australia in search of brand deals.


For brands in Australia, this means you are missing out on a lucrative marketing channel if you have not started working with Indian influencers from ShareChat.


You are probably wondering how that works. No need for alarm! I have thoroughly researched this new trend.


Let‚Äôs get started.


## üí° Getting to Know ShareChat


![ShareChat](https://m.economictimes.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-10654308,width-600,height-400,quality-85,overlay-etbrandequity/photo/10654308.jpg)

Founded in 2015, ShareChat is a popular Indian social media platform that caters specifically to Indian users. The app allows users to share content in a regional language.


With over 100 million downloads on Google Playstore, ShareChat boasts of over 180 million monthly active users as of 2022.


This massive growth rate is attributed to the fact that it serves a market largely untouched by its competitors like Facebook and Instagram. Most of its users come from rural India, and it has grown rapidly in markets like Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh.


## üìä ShareChat Compared to Other Platforms


Despite the popularity of ShareChat, many people outside of India have no idea what it is. A recent report showed that it has over 33% of the social media market share in India, which is more than Facebook and Instagram combined.


To put this in perspective, here are social media usage stats in India:

- **ShareChat** ‚Äì 33.19%
- **Facebook** ‚Äì 16.71%
- **YouTube** ‚Äì 10.55%
- **Instagram** ‚Äì 4.24%
- **Twitter** ‚Äì 2.78%
- **Snapchat** ‚Äì 1.78%

The report also revealed that ShareChat will be the only social media platform in India to grow its market share by 2025. By then, ShareChat will have an impressive 51% share of the market.


## üì¢ Why Australian Brands Should Work with Indian Influencers on ShareChat


![Why Brands Should Work with ShareChat Influencers](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D12AQEZ4HjeRtK0qg/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1685137907330?e=1700073600&v=beta&t=G--OjOE4LD7F1LhP3e9GSUsj9ig9tbpOlxkJhxNxosI)

The shift to using ShareChat influencers from India is due to several reasons. 

First, Indian influencers are cost-effective compared to local Australian influencers. This opens up an affordable marketing channel for Australian companies.


Secondly, since ShareChat uses regional languages, Indian influencers can target specific audiences by using local languages and dialects. This is something that many influencers do not do on global platforms like TikTok and Instagram.


For example, a large number of Australian Indians will identify with influencers who speak their local dialect. 

The Australian Indian community is over 700,000 strong, and it is only growing. Many Australians with Indian heritage find Indian influencers more relatable.


Many locals might not speak English at home, so they would gravitate more toward content and influencers that speak their dialects. ShareChat influencers are perfect for targeting these communities.

This niche targeting capability is something that mainstream influencers cannot match.


## üì¢ How ShareChat Influencers Approach Australian Brands for Collaborations


Reachouts are the lifeblood of any influencer marketing campaign. To land a brand deal, an influencer must first convince a company that they will deliver results.


So how do ShareChat influencers manage to do this so well? 


According to a report by Business Insider India, influencers from ShareChat have fully embraced the Indian way of doing business.


The Indian way is predicated on the fact that relationships come first before any deal is made. 


This is why most Western businesspeople find it challenging to form connections with Indian associates.


Australian companies must understand that for Indian influencers to work with them, they must first establish a relationship.


The most common approach is to connect through WhatsApp for a casual chat. This allows the influencer to break the ice with the potential brand partner.


After some time, the influencer will then approach the brand and suggest a collaboration.


They may also ask the brand to share some of their products or services. By doing this, the influencer can create valuable content that highlights the brand they are hoping to work with.


Over time, the influencer can then pitch a paid collaboration.


## ‚ùó Do Not Forget Payment Options


Getting paid is the most critical part of brand deals. Failure to pay an influencer can ruin your marketing campaign.


One of the most significant hurdles for brands in Australia when dealing with Indian influencers is the payment options.


Many local brands are used to the convenience of paying influencers using online payment processors like PayPal. 


Unfortunately, most Indian influencers do not have access to these payment options. India has strict currency controls that limit international transactions.


For example, Indian citizens can only send $250,000 a year outside of the country. 


This includes online payments. So for this reason, Indian influencers cannot use online payment options like PayPal or Stripe.


Australian brands must be willing to use other payment options that many Indian influencers have. 


There are several worldwide payment solutions that can facilitate transactions between Australian brands and Indian influencers:



1. **Wise (Formerly TransferWise)**

Wise is an international payment processor that has gained popularity among many Indian online entrepreneurs.


Wise rewrites the rules of international money transfer. When you send money abroad with Wise, it‚Äôs converted at the mid-market rate. 


This method is fast and cheaper than a bank.  Most importantly, it allows Indian influencers to receive money directly into their bank account.


2. **Payoneer**

Payoneer is another great payment option that many Indian influencers are using today.


The platform allows you to send and receive money globally. 


With Payoneer, Indian influencers can also receive payments from PayPal if they have a Payoneer account.


3. **Remitly**

Remitly is a digital alternative to cash and check for sending money internationally.


Many Indian influencers totally love using Remitly. That‚Äôs why Australian brands must consider using it as a payment option.


### üìå Conclusion


The bottom line is that Indian ShareChat influencers are coming to Australia. They are here, and they are ready to partner with Australian brands.


This new trend is driven by the massive growth of ShareChat in India and the Indian diaspora in Australia. 

Australian brands must not stand still and let the opportunity pass them by.


## üí° Future Predictions


There are several predictions made about ShareChat and its influencers.

According to a report by Influencer Marketing Hub, India will lead the way in influencer marketing by 2025.
