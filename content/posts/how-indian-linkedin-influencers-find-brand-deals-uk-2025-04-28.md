In recent years, LinkedIn influencers have become a notable part of the social media landscape. Unlike popular Instagram and YouTuber influencers who are mostly seen advertising products, LinkedIn influencers delve into the art of selling ideas. 

They develop an impressive follower base that is comprised of professionals looking to improve their business acumen, career prospects, or industry knowledge. Brands then get these influencers to create content that promotes their services or products while utilizing this vast pool of professionals as a target market. 

This new breed of influencer marketers has emerged in India as well, and many of them are even finding brand deals across borders, specifically in the UK. Let's delve deeper into how Indian LinkedIn influencers are going about this process. 

## 🚀 The Rise of LinkedIn Influencer Marketing in India

Influencer marketing in India has grown remarkably over the years, but it has mostly focused on Instagram and YouTube due to the nature of the platforms. However, as professionals everywhere spend more time on LinkedIn, it has become a viable marketing option for brands looking to break into corporate spaces. 

According to Koo, a social media platform that has also become popular in India, posts by LinkedIn influencers have a 20x higher engagement rate than regular posts. This has encouraged brands to flock to LinkedIn influencers in search of that engagement. 

The number of LinkedIn influencers in India has skyrocketed in recent years, with many of them even boasting millions of followers on their profiles, like Raj Shamani. Raj is not only a LinkedIn influencer but also a digital entrepreneur and investor. With over 3.4 million followers and a 106 million content views in just 2 years, Raj has established himself as a leading influencer on the platform. 

Raj is not only influential on LinkedIn but has also partnered with many brands, including global brands like BMW and Cafe Coffee Day. He even founded a talent management agency for LinkedIn influencers called the Shamani Group. This agency has helped many LinkedIn influencers get brand deals not just in India but also abroad in countries like the UK. 

## 🤝 How Indian LinkedIn Influencers Get UK Brand Deals

LinkedIn influencers in India have multiple ways to land brand deals in the UK. Some of those methods are more conventional than others, but they are all effective in their own right. Here are the 4 main ways that Indian LinkedIn influencers are getting UK brand deals:

### 1. Through LinkedIn

The first and most obvious way is through LinkedIn itself. As a professional networking platform, LinkedIn has many tools at the disposal of users to enhance their networking experience. 

One of those tools is the ability to send and receive direct messages from other users. LinkedIn influencers have leveraged this tool to the fullest by reaching out to brands that they believe would benefit from their influencer marketing services. 

In fact, this method has proven to be so effective that over 60% of brands are now reaching out to influencers themselves instead of hiring influencer marketing agencies. This has created a more democratized influencer marketing space, especially on LinkedIn where brands and influencers can easily reach one another when looking to collaborate. 

Many Indian LinkedIn influencers are now reaching out to brands that have a presence in the UK but have not yet advertised their products or services on LinkedIn in the region. They pitch their services to these brands and if all goes well, they secure a deal and get to work. 

### 2. Using Influencer Marketing Agencies 

Although many Indian LinkedIn influencers are landing UK brand deals on their own, some still prefer to work through influencer marketing agencies. Even in 2025, many brands still prefer working with agencies because they handle all the hard work, including vetting, negotiating, and payment processing. 

This is even more applicable for brands that may not have a social media presence in India or in the case of UK brands, a presence in India. They are more comfortable working with a third party that specializes in marketing and social media, and this is why many brands still hire influencer marketing agencies to connect with influencers. 

Some of the most notable influencer marketing agencies that have worked with Indian LinkedIn influencers to secure UK brand deals include:

- **Kreativeminds**: This agency has worked with multiple Indian LinkedIn influencers to land numerous high-paying brand deals. 
- **Influence4You**: Initially founded in France, this agency has now expanded into the Indian influencer marketing space and is working with influencers across multiple platforms, including LinkedIn. 

### 3. Through Their Networks

Networking is an important part of social media, so it is not surprising that Indian LinkedIn influencers leverage their networks to secure brand deals in the UK. 

Because LinkedIn is a public platform, many professionals, including Indian LinkedIn influencers, have developed extensive networks. This has allowed them to get in contact with professionals that work at brands directly without going through multiple layers of communication. This is especially helpful when brands have more than one social media presence. 

Indian LinkedIn influencers have been able to reach out to professionals working at UK brands and pitch their influencer marketing services. In some cases, these professionals have even secured deals for the influencers by relaying the information to their superiors who then approve a collaboration. 

### 4. Through Referrals

LinkedIn influencers do not only get brand deals by reaching out to brands themselves. They also get referrals from other influencers who already have brand deals. This is similar to their networks approach, but this time it is the influencer’s competitors that are doing the work for them. 

When a brand reaches out to an influencer looking to collaborate, the influencer may not be able to do so for various reasons. In such a case, the influencer can refer another influencer instead. This is often called a “warm handoff” because the influencer is still in touch with the brand and can easily connect the two parties. 

This method is not only effective but has also helped Indian LinkedIn influencers partner with some of the most notable brands in the UK, including NHS, Accenture, Deloitte, and many others. 

## 💼 LinkedIn Brand Deals Are Different

Unlike other social media platforms, LinkedIn brand deals require a different approach. Many brands that operate on LinkedIn like to keep things professional and succinct, and this is what Indian LinkedIn influencers have been doing. 

In 2025, LinkedIn influencers will still be creating content that is polished and tailored to meet the expectations of their audiences and the brands they work with. This means that they will be leveraging their expertise and experience in their respective fields to create content that resonates with their audiences, ensures engagement, and drives conversions.

## ️💳 How Indian LinkedIn Influencers Get Paid

Indian LinkedIn influencers are paid for their services just like regular influencers. Brands can pay them in cash or barter with products and services. However, as many of these influencers are landing brand deals outside of India, especially in the UK, they have to get creative when getting paid. 

### 1. Bank Transfers

The first and most obvious way that Indian LinkedIn influencers are getting paid is through bank transfers. Many brands still prefer paying cash for the services of influencers, especially if the influencers are working through an agency. 

Luckily, many brands in the UK have a local presence in India, involving them being registered companies. Because of this, they can pay Indian LinkedIn influencers just like any other company in India.  

In cases where UK brands do not have a local presence in India, they can still send money to Indian LinkedIn influencers through bank transfers. All they need to do is provide the influencer with their banking details, including their account number and IFSC code. 

### 2. Online Payment Platforms

In 2025, online payment platforms will still be a popular way for Indian LinkedIn influencers to receive payments for their services. Many brands now prefer using online payment platforms to make payments because it is quick and easy. 

Some of the most popular online payment platforms that Indian LinkedIn influencers are being paid through include:

- **PayPal**: This platform is one of the most popular online payment platforms worldwide. Many brands across various countries use it to make payments to Indian LinkedIn influencers. 
- **Wise**: Originally called TransferWise, Wise is another popular online payment platform that allows brands in the UK to send money to Indian LinkedIn influencers. 
- **Payoneer**: This online payment platform has also become popular among brands that want to pay Indian LinkedIn influencers for their services. 

## 📣 Is There a Future for Indian LinkedIn Influencers in UK Brand Deals?

Yes, there is definitely a future for Indian LinkedIn influencers in UK brand deals. Demand for influencer marketing on LinkedIn is only going to increase, especially with the rise of LinkedIn as a lead generation platform.

Additionally, brands are also expected to increase their budgets for LinkedIn influencer marketing, allowing influencers to secure more lucrative brand deals.
