These stats indicate the growing popularity of the platform and its influencer community. 

## üí∞ How Influencers Monetize ShareChat

The popularity of ShareChat influencers can be attributed to the multiple monetization opportunities the platform provides. 

ShareChat has launched several programs to help creators earn handsomely. Currently, influencers on ShareChat can earn from:

## üìä Brand Interest in ShareChat Influencers

## ‚úàÔ∏è Singaporean Brands Eyeing the Indian Market

As Indian influencers have become more aware of the lucrative Singaporean market, Singaporean brands have also begun to eye Indian influencers for their campaigns. 

Singapore is home to several successful brands and companies. It is also home to a massive Indian community. 

According to reports, brands in Singapore are looking to target younger audiences in India. Influencer marketing is an effective way to do just that. 

The reports further state that Singaporean brands have begun running influencer campaigns in India to secure a foothold in the country. 

Some notable brands include:

- **Gojek:** The Indonesian ride-hailing giant has established a presence in Singapore and is eyeing India next.
- **Klook:** The Hong Kong-based travel tech company has also expanded its operations in India and is looking to leverage influencers to promote its platform across Singapore and India. 
- **Chow Tai Fook Jewelry:** The Hong Kong-based jewelry brand has already started influencer campaigns in India to promote its products in Singapore and the rest of Southeast Asia.

As brands on both sides have begun to pursue the other, Indian ShareChat influencers have emerged as the ideal bridges between the two communities. 

## üì± ShareChat Influencers in Singapore

Given the Indian diaspora in Singapore, it is little wonder that Indian ShareChat influencers have begun to focus their attention on the Southeast Asian city-state. 

According to reports, around 14% of Singaporeans are of Indian descent. The Indian community is the largest minority in Singapore. 

Singapore is also home to a number of Indian nationals who have relocated there for work opportunities. 

As a result, there is a lot of interest from the Indian community in Singapore regarding Indian brands and products. Therefore, ShareChat influencers have begun targeting Singapore for influencer opportunities. 

Influencers are aware that there is a large and lucrative potential audience for them to serve across the border. 

## üîç How ShareChat Influencers Are Finding Singaporean Brands

Indian influencers on ShareChat have begun utilizing their local knowledge and connections to Singapore to find lucrative brand deals. 

The influencers are leveraging the large Indian community in Singapore to win lucrative marketing deals. From connecting with brands to participating in campaigns, they are doing it all. 

Take the case of influencer Ekta Bhadra. The beauty content creator is based in Delhi but has deep connections to Singapore. Her father, uncle, and grandmother live in Singapore, while her aunt is married to a Singaporean. 

As a result, she is strongly connected to the Indian community in Singapore. 

According to reports, the influencer has found multiple brand deals in Singapore. She was able to secure a deal with a Singapore-based beauty spa for her to promote their service on ShareChat. 

The influencer is now able to visit Singapore regularly to meet family and work. 

‚ÄúMy father was working for Singapore Airlines when I was a child, so my family has always been connected to the city-nation. In fact, I have many relatives there that I visit and stay with when I travel. It‚Äôs like a second home,‚Äù she said in a statement.

The influencer also shared, ‚ÄúI did not aim for Singapore. I just wanted to do what I loved, but with my contacts there, it seemed like a natural choice to expand my influencer turf.‚Äù

When asked how she was able to find the brand in Singapore, she stated, ‚ÄúI used my cousin‚Äôs help to connect with the owner. I have known her since childhood, and she is equally passionate about beauty.‚Äù

She concluded by stating, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a win-win! I get to earn while working for a brand that resonates with me, and I get to visit Singapore often.‚Äù

## üë©‚Äçüè´ Singaporean Students in India Find a New Opportunity

While many Singaporean brands are looking to market their products and services in India, Singaporean students in India have found an opportunity to connect with brands in Singapore. 

Many students relocate to India for studies, especially in the medical field. According to reports, around 15% of the cohort entering medical schools in Singapore relocates to India. 

Therefore, Singaporean students in India have also begun pursuing influencer opportunities in Singapore. 

Take the case of influencer Nikita Ng, for example. Nikita is from Singapore, but she is studying in India. The influencer is also a popular content creator on ShareChat. 

In a recent statement, she shared, ‚ÄúI know that Singaporeans in India are a small minority, but we want to represent our home country! Influencer marketing is very popular in Singapore, so I thought it would be a good idea to do influencer marketing for Singaporean brands here in India.‚Äù

Nikita is currently based in a university in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. She has focused her work on promoting Singaporean brands in India. 

According to reports, she has worked with a number of Singaporean brands already. 

## ü™Ñ Strategies Indian ShareChat Influencers Use to Find Brand Deals in Singapore

When it comes to winning brand deals, Indian ShareChat influencers are pulling out all the stops. 

They are utilizing their extensive local knowledge and connections to Singapore to find lucrative deals. 

Let‚Äôs take a look at some of the strategies Indian ShareChat influencers are deploying to win brand deals in Singapore! 

### 1. Leveraging Connections

As we've seen, some Indian influencers on ShareChat like Ekta Bhadra are actively leveraging their connections in Singapore to find brand deals. 

They are exploring all their options and connections on both sides to secure lucrative deals.  

### 2. Exploring Cultural Touchpoints

Cultural touchpoints play a significant role in connecting people across borders. 

Indian influencers are leveraging cultural touchpoints between Singaporeans and Indians to find brand deals in Singapore. 

For instance, influencer Priyanka Soni is also targeting Singapore for brand deals. 

The influencer is currently based in Indore and found out about the possibility of Singapore from her grandfather. According to her, there are many similarities between Indian and Singaporean cultures. 

She stated, ‚ÄúMy grandfather used to do Indore‚Äôs famous poha for breakfast, but instead of green chilies, he used bird‚Äôs eye chilis instead! This is something Singaporeans enjoy in their food as well.‚Äù 

Based on this cultural touchpoint, the influencer has built her identity. She is focusing on bridging Indian and Singaporean cultures through her content. 

She stated, ‚ÄúSo, my entire thing is to offer Indian cuisine to Singaporeans who live in India and Indians who live in Singapore! There are many cultural touchpoints between both communities, and cuisine is a big one.‚Äù 

As we can see, cultural touchpoints play a significant role in bridging differences. They are a powerful tool for Indian ShareChat influencers to connect with Singaporean brands. 

### 3. Seeking Out Singaporean Brands

While many Singaporean brands have begun to eye the Indian market, there are still many that are yet to do so. 

Indian ShareChat influencers are actively seeking out Singaporean brands to tap into the lucrative market. 

Many Singaporean brands have already begun to market their products in India. While some Singaporean brands residing in Singapore are looking to enter the India market, others are already in India looking for ways to promote their services. 

As a result, many Indian influencers have begun to research Singaporean brands to see if they can connect with them. 

Some influencers have even stated that they are actively reaching out to Singaporean brands. For instance, influencer Nikita Ng stated, ‚ÄúI have reached out to Singaporean brands that I think would be interested in marketing their products in India.‚Äù 

### 4. Finding Local Singaporean Brands

In their research efforts, many Indian ShareChat influencers have found that there are several Singaporean brands already operating in India. 

These influencers have begun to reach out to local Singaporean brands to connect them with brands in Singapore. 

According to reports, there have already been several successful collaborations between ShareChat influencers and Singaporean brands in India. 

Some influencers have even formed collective teams to target Singaporean brands. Take, for instance, influencer Susan Yadav. 

The influencer discovered that there is a Singaporean spa in Gurugram. The spa is called Kinsale Beauty Spa and is operated by Singaporean hair and beauty consultant Kim Kwan Thong. 

Yadav discovered the local Singaporean beauty spa through a YouTube video. She then contacted three other Singaporean influencers in India. 

Together, the four influencers were able to connect Kinsale Beauty Spa with a skincare brand in Singapore. 

Yadav stated, ‚ÄúWe have connected Kinsale Beauty Spa with a skincare brand in Singapore. The brand wanted to find influencers who could market its products in Singapore and India. That‚Äôs where we came in! We are all thrilled to work together!‚Äù 

### 5. Using English as the Common Language

As we have seen, Indian ShareChat influencers have been able to connect with Singaporean brands due to their deep-rooted connections and knowledge of Singapore. 

But, Singaporean brands often require influencers who can speak Singlish or Singaporean English. 

While the English language is the common language spoken in Singapore, Singaporeans have a unique way of speaking it. 

They often include different local dialects, colloquialisms, and slang in their English. 

According to reports, some Indian influencers are even learning Singlish to connect with Singaporean brands. 

### 6. Collaborating with Other Influencers

While many Indian influencers have succeeded in finding Singaporean brands to collaborate with, some have not been so lucky. 

These influencers are reaching out to others who have been successful in finding brand deals in Singapore. 

By collaborating with these other influencers, they hope to win lucrative brand deals too. 

For example, influencer Nikita Ng stated, ‚ÄúI have reached out to Indian influencers who have found Singaporean brands.‚Äù 

She also mentioned that she has collaborated with some of them as well. 

## üí≠ Conclusion 

Singapore is home to a significant Indian diaspora. As a result, the city-state is a lucrative market for Indian influencers to pursue. 

As Singaporean brands begin to eye the Indian market, Indian ShareChat influencers are pulling out all the stops to find lucrative brand deals in Singapore! 

It is an exciting time for Indian ShareChat influencers.
