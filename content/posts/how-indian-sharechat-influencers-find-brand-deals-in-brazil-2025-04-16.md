ShareChat influencers from India are finding lucrative brand deals in Brazil while using their homegrown platform to reach potential customers. 

While reaching out to brands via email is a common way of pitching for an influencer, ShareChat influencers have taken it up a notch by using the platform itself to send DMs to brands.


üì© **ShareChat DMs for pitching to brands is big in Brazil**

Sending DMs to brands is commonplace for influencers, but the business module of ShareChat allows influencers to sell their DM services to brands.

Influencers on ShareChat Brazil have been pitching their DM services by showcasing their past experiences of reaching out to brands and increasing their business while working with them. 


For instance, **Vishal Jain**, a ShareChat influencer from India, who has made a name for himself in Brazil, has been offering brands in Brazil a service of 100 DMs on ShareChat.

Vishal Jain said he learnt that many brands were unaware that ShareChat exists. To help them, he sends them DMs on the same platform. 


In the DMs, he shares the information that they can connect and sell their products on the platform where people speak the language that their products are tailored for.


üì¢ **Why the need for ShareChat DM influencers?**

Many brands want to reach a specific section of the population. The population of Brazil speaks Portuguese, so it would be ideal for brands to connect with them in their local language. This is where the ShareChat platform comes in.



Brands that are looking to expand their customer base in Brazil now have the luxury of DMs by those who specialize in them.

The brands can give their content to the ShareChat DMs influencer who will then send the content out in bulk to users on the platform and create the awareness needed and thus increase sales for the brands.


ü§ë **A lucrative venture for influencers**

The DM service is highly sought after by brands in Brazil as it is reasonably priced.

The service of 100 DMs on ShareChat costs just 1500 rupees. For translators, it costs 900 rupees to translate content from Hindi to Portuguese.

Thus, it costs brands just 2400 rupees to have their business showcased via DMs on ShareChat.

The costs incurred by brands will yield them greater profits due to the immense sales conversion they will achieve. 


üí∞ **How influencers are capitalizing on DMs by brands**

The price range for this service is from 1000 to 6000 rupees depending on the number of DMs they want, the more 100s a brand order, the more value for their budget.


üìà **Why DM service influencers are in demand in Brazil**

In Brazil, there exists a phenomenon called ‚Äúmeme influencers‚Äù. Meme influencers create memes about brands.

üéÅ **Why sending ShareChat DMs to brands is the best strategy**

Sending DMs to brands is often met with skepticism.

Brands wonder whether influencers are just trying to dupe them into sending them free products or money. 

This is why many influencers who send emails to brands do not get replies.

However, for influencers who are offering to send DMs to brands, they have a semblance of credibility. Why? Because they are sending DMs on the same platform brands need to promote their products.


üé¥ **More ways for ShareChat influencers to monetize**

Apart from their DMs for brands and DMs for hire services, ShareChat influencers can also monetize as sellers of virtual gifts.
