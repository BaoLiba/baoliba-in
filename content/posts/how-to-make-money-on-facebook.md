Consider a picture of your product as your cover photo and your logo as your profile picture, or use a catchy tagline as your cover photo.

Make sure to include a link to your website if you have one, your business email, and your location to help users find you.

Regularly sharing updates keeps your audience engaged. 

You can post product photos, behind-the-scenes videos, or even tutorials on how to use your products.
