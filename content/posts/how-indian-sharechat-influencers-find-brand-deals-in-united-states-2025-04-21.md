The world of influencer marketing has undergone a significant transformation with the rise of Indian-origin influencers on ShareChat, Instagram, TikTok, and Youtube.

According to reports, the market for influencer marketing in India is expected to reach USD 375 million by 2025, with Indian-origin influencers on ShareChat being the industry's largest part.

As brand deals become more lucrative and accessible, Indian influencers are setting their sights on securing international brand partnerships, particularly from the United States.

They are employing various methods to connect with American brands, including using influencer marketing agencies and social media to apply directly for brand deals.

üì± **ShareChat Buzz is the Biggest Forum for Influencers to Discuss Deals** 

The ShareChat Buzz group has over 200,000 members, making it one of the biggest groups in the influencer marketing industry. 

With increasing demand for Indian-origin influencers and the group serving as a bridge between Indian influencers and American brands, it is likely that a significant number of Indian-origin influencers and major American brands have already connected via the group.

The group was created by ShareChat and has several teams managing it to ensure that members do not spam it with irrelevant messages and comments. 

Members can apply for brand deals, and many have shared successful brand partnerships they secured through the group. 

ShareChat employees also monitor the group and participate in discussions to assist influencers and brands.

Influencers can also find brand deals by contacting other members who are mainly affiliate marketers and marketing executives that can help influencers secure paid sponsorships.


üíº **Many Influencers Partner with Influencer Marketing Agencies**


The influencer marketing industry has also experienced rapid growth in India, with many companies focusing on Indian-origin influencers on ShareChat. 

According to reports, there has been a surge in influencer marketing agencies in India, with 250 new agencies launched in the country every month over the past year. 

The report also found that Indian influencers on ShareChat are the most sought-after and the agencies are supporting them with services like applying for international brand deals. 

ShareChat, which is owned by Mohalla Tech and has its headquarters in Bengaluru, has 250 million monthly active users, making it the largest social media platform in India.


Many of ShareChat's Indian-origin influencers have worked with American brands through the influencer marketing agencies. 

In addition to running these agencies, many of the agency owners are also influencers on ShareChat and are usually former influencers themselves.


‚úàÔ∏è **Influencers Travel to the USA for Paid Promotions**


Many Indian influencers on ShareChat are securing brand deals with American brands that require them to travel to the USA. 

Indian-origin ShareChat influencers who have over 1 million followers can charge brands $100,000 for a 30-second promotion. 

Besides charging high fees for brand partnerships, many Indian ShareChat influencers have a favorable conversion rate when working with American brands due to their growing popularity in the USA.


üåç **How ShareChat Influencers from India Reach Out to USA Brands**


Currently, many Indian influencers on ShareChat are contacting American brands on behalf of their Indian-origin affiliates who have large followings. 

This method of securing brand deals is prevalent among many affiliate executives that are members of ShareChat Buzz. 

Unfortunately, many prospective influencers on ShareChat do not have the experience or knowledge to approach American brands for brand deals. 

This has also led to many affiliate marketers and marketing executives contacting them to supply the services for a fee. 


Lecturers, professors, and students pursuing studies in the USA have also created awareness about Indian-origin influencers on ShareChat. 

Individuals within this demographic have traveled to India and made videos about their experiences in the country, with many of them going viral. 

Many of the videos have garnered millions of views, boosting the popularity of ShareChat influencers in the USA. 

These American citizens are the ones spreading the word about Indian-origin influencers on ShareChat and helping them connect with American brands.

The video-sharing app is also trying to penetrate the American market footprint. 

The app is facing immense competition from other video-sharing apps, like TikTok, which is also attempting to expand its reach in India. 

A few weeks ago, ShareChat announced its plan to lay off 20% of its workforce, which is about 500 employees. The job cuts are part of a wider effort to become a profitable company and enter the American market.

üì¢ **ShareChat Influencers Represent the Rise of Indian Digital Creators**



As one of the biggest social media platforms in India, ShareChat has already begun setting the stage for Indian-origin influencers to reach brands in the USA. 

Many leading brands are searching for Indian-origin influencers on ShareChat to represent their interests in one of the world‚Äôs largest growth markets, India. 

Currently, many American brands are investing heavily in influencer marketing to reach Indian consumers who have already been shown to have a growing disposable income that is much higher than in previous years.

Many Indian-origin influencers on ShareChat can increase their followers and engagement metrics through brand deals with American brands. 

This is mainly due to the credibility and social proof that comes with working for established brands. 

As influencer marketing continues to evolve, Indian-origin influencers on ShareChat are likely to flourish and expand their reach globally!


üí° **What is ShareChat?**


ShareChat is a social media and networking service that enables users to share and discover content in various Indian languages. 

The application claims a monthly active user count of 250 million as of December 2022, making it the largest social media platform in India. 

Launched in 2015, ShareChat is owned by Mohalla Tech and headquartered in Bengaluru, India.

The application is available on Android and iOS and is only accessible within India. 

It has been the subject of multiple attempts to ban it due to its large user base and intense scrutiny from the Indian government, which accused it of spreading misinformation and not complying with data localization policies.


üí° **What is the Growth of Influencer Marketing in India?**


Despite being a latecomer to the influencer marketing space, the industry has been growing rapidly, in line with the growth of social media in the country. 

According to Business Today, influencer marketing in India is projected to reach $375 million in revenue by 2025, up from $75‚Äì$150 million in 2022. 

This growth is due to the increasing interest of marketers in influencer marketing. Companies are allotting at least 10% of their overall marketing budget to influencer marketing. 

This is good news for more than four million influencers within the country, including micro-influencers who have 10,000‚Äì50,000 followers.


üí° **The Rise of Micro-Influencers**


Micro-influencers with a small number of followers on ShareChat have been shown to have a greater engagement rate compared to influencers with millions of followers. 

Due to this, the demand for micro-influencers on ShareChat has surged and many agencies now specialize in sourcing only micro-influencers. 


According to studies conducted by platforms serving the influencer marketing industry, a micro-influencer's engagement rate ranges from 4%‚Äì8%, while influencers with millions of followers can have engagement rates as low as 1%.

Micro-influencers also have a high conversion rate due to their followers perceiving them as friends and more relatable than mainstream influencers with millions of followers. 

Micro-influencers become trusted sources of information for their loyal followers, increasing the likelihood of them buying products or services that they promote.


üì¢ **Importance of Influencer Marketing in India**


Today's Indian consumers follow digital creators to discover products, services, and experiences. 

They prefer to receive their marketing messages from individuals they can relate to rather than brands trying to sell them something. 

This is why influencer marketing has become crucial for companies looking to reach Indian consumers. 

Many leading brands in India have already jumped on board and started working with influencers on ShareChat to promote their products and services, and this trend is expected to continue.


üí° **What are the Challenges Faced by Influencers on ShareChat?**


According to a report from the Financial Express, despite the growing popularity of influencer marketing, many influencers on ShareChat are struggling to get paid for their services. 

Many brands are engaging influencers to promote their products and services, but many brands fail to pay influencers even after they provide the agreed services. 


A report by Business Insider found that 45% of influencers in India have faced delayed payments or have not gotten paid at all for their services. 

Many influencers on ShareChat have also created a community representing them to address the issues that they face regarding secured payments, contracts, and terms of service. 

The community is known as the ShareChat Buzz Influence Council and has started taking aggressive measures to ensure that brands fulfill their payments.

ShareChat Buzz has also implemented a new feature that allows influencers to leave reviews of brands. 

The review feature is similar to the one that exists for sellers on Amazon. 

Currently, the review feature is only available to certain influencers, but if it is rolled out to all influencers, it could help them manage brands that fail to pay them for their services. 

Many influencers on ShareChat, especially micro-influencers, are mainly students and those who remain dependent on their parents to support their education. 

Being unpaid and struggling to make ends meet, many have been forced to drop out of school or college to work and support themselves.


üí° **Conclusion**


Influencer marketing is expected to reach great heights in India, especially with the rise of Indian-origin influencers on ShareChat. 

Many of these influencers are already securing brand deals with American brands, and more Indian-origin influencers on ShareChat are likely to secure lucrative brand partnerships in 2023. 

Despite many challenges hampering their growth, those who remain focused are likely to continue scaling their influence on the platform.

As the ShareChat Buzz community and the ShareChat Buzz Influencer Council continue supporting influencers, and ShareChat implements new features that benefit influencers, many influencers are likely to thrive.
