- **Micro influencers** ($50-$200): With a larger following of 10,000 to 50,000, micro influencers have a broader reach while still maintaining a strong connection with their audience.

## ü§ù Collaboration Types with Pinterest Influencers in Vietnam

- **Product reviews**: Influencers can create honest reviews of the brand's products, showcasing their features and benefits. These reviews can provide valuable insights for potential customers and can help build trust in the brand.

- **How-to guides and tutorials**: Pinterest is known for its DIY content, so influencers can create how-to guides or tutorials that incorporate the brand's products. This type of content can provide valuable information to users and showcase the products in action.

- **Video content**: Influencers can create videos showcasing the brand's products or services. Video content is highly engaging and can be shared across multiple platforms, increasing the brand's reach.
