ShareChat is a leading Indian social media giant, and its influencer marketing program is growing stronger by the day. Recently, a study by local news agency The Himalayan Times stated that many influencers from India are actually being hired by major brands in Nepal.


The study found that Indian influencers on ShareChat, particularly those from the Indo-Nepal border region, are being used extensively in influencer marketing campaigns in Nepal. 


Not only that, many influencers from India have gained a huge following in Nepal, rivaling that of local influencers. 


Indian influencers are thus not only finding deals with leading brands across the border, they are also gaining massive followership in the Himalayan country, which is becoming a major outbound market for Indian influencers and brands. 


## üìà Why are more Indian ShareChat influencers becoming popular in Nepal?

The Himalayan Times reports that there is a high demand for influencer marketing by major brands in Nepal, particularly in the Indo-Nepal border provinces of the country. 


The report mentioned that many Indian influencers from Bengal, Sikkim, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar are being hired by Nepali brands. 


The report also stated that many Indian influencers have garnered a huge following in Nepal, and that their popularity is increasing at a significant rate. 


Bihar and Uttar Pradesh alone are home to a large population of Nepali speakers, who are thus more inclined to follow influencers who speak their native language. 


In short, Indian ShareChat influencers are not only finding steady brand deals in Nepal, they are also gaining massive followership. 


## üë§ Who are these influencers?

According to The Himalayan Times, many Indian influencers with popular accounts on ShareChat are currently finding brand deals in Nepal, while others have amassed a huge following in Nepal.


Some specific examples of Indian influencers on ShareChat who have found great popularity in Nepal include:

1. **Bihar and Sikkim based influencers:** According to the report, many influencers based in Bihar and Sikkim are being hired for influencer marketing campaigns in Nepal. This is due to the high concentration of people of Nepali origin residing in Bihar and Sikkim.

Bihar‚Äôs Araria and West Champaran districts are home to about two million people of Nepali origin. Similarly, Nepali speakers make up about 25% of the population in Sikkim, the Himalayan state that is a neighbor to Nepal. 


2.  **Satindra Yadav:** Satindra Yadav is currently one of the most popular influencers from Bihar on ShareChat. He has amassed over 490,000 followers on the platform. 

According to The Himalayan Times, Yadav has received numerous requests from Nepali local brands and even international brands operating in Nepal to promote their products and services. 


3. **Manish Kumar:** Manish Kumar is another influencer who has gained great popularity in Nepal. He is popular for creating entertaining videos and has garnered over 720,000 followers on ShareChat. 

Kumar has also received requests to promote products and services of various brands based in Nepal. 


4. **Sanjay Bhardwaj:** Sanjay Bhardwaj is also another emerging influencer on ShareChat who has gained a huge following in Nepal. 

Bhardwaj, who is based in West Champaran district of Bihar, also has multiple times requested brands based in Nepal to send him their products for reviews. 


## ü™ô How do Indian ShareChat influencers get paid for brand deals in Nepal?

According to The Himalayan Times, cash is the primary mode of payment for Indian influencers working with brands in Nepal.


However, cash payment from Nepal involves cross-border transactions which can incur high fees and delays. 


To bypass these issues, many brands in Nepal are using cash apps like **eSewa** and **IME Pay** to send payments to Indian ShareChat influencers.


Brands in Nepal can send cash payments to Indian influencers on ShareChat using either eSewa or IME Pay. 


**eSewa** is a digital wallet service based in Nepal that also works in India. Established in 2009, it is Nepal‚Äôs first online payment gateway and is currently the leading digital wallet service in the country.

**IME Pay** is also a leading digital wallet service in Nepal that enables users to make payments using their mobile phones. IME Pay is operated by IME Group, which is a company that runs money transfer and remittance services across the globe. 


## ü§î Are cash apps the only way to get paid by Nepali brands?

While cash apps are the primary mode of payment for Indian influencers working with brands in Nepal, some influencers are also being paid in Nepali rupees. 



According to The Himalayan Times, some influencers from India are also finding payments from Nepali brands in Indian rupees. 


They are then converting the Indian rupees to Nepali rupees through third-party financial services providers. 


## üí∞ How much are Indian ShareChat influencers charging Nepali brands for brand deals?

The Himalayan Times reports that the price Indian ShareChat influencers are charging Nepali brands for brand deals varies significantly.


According to the report, influencers with a substantial following on ShareChat are charging brands between **Rs. 5,000** (equivalent to INR 3,100) to **Rs. 20,000** (equivalent to INR 12,400) for a single promotional video.


However, smaller influencers with a smaller following are charging between **Rs. 1,000** (equivalent to INR 620) to **Rs. 3,000** (equivalent to INR 1,900) for a promotional video.



These rates are generally less than what Indian influencers charge to promote brands within India. 


## üìä What kind of brands are hiring Indian ShareChat influencers from Nepal?

According to The Himalayan Times, Indian influencers on ShareChat are being hired by a wide range of brands in Nepal. 

Some of the brands that have hired Indian influencers from ShareChat for influencer marketing campaigns include:

1. **Khanal Foods:** Khanal Foods is a popular food company in Nepal that has used Indian influencers on ShareChat for influencer marketing campaigns. 

The CEO of Khanal Foods, Ms. Shristi Khanal, revealed to The Himalayan Times that they are using Indian influencers from the Indo-Nepal border region to promote their products due to their popularity in Nepal. 


2. **Redmi Nepal:** Redmi Nepal, the official distributor of Redmi smartphones in Nepal, is also hiring Indian influencers from ShareChat for influencer marketing campaigns. 

One of the influencers hired by Redmi Nepal is Sanjay Bhardwaj, who previously worked with Khanal Foods as well. 


## ‚ùó Will Nepali brands continue to hire Indian ShareChat influencers for brand deals?

The Himalayan Times reports that Nepali brands will continue to hire Indian ShareChat influencers for brand deals. 


According to the report, Nepali brands are looking for influencers who speak and understand the Nepali language fluently. 


However, there is a major shortage of influencers who can fluently speak and understand the Nepali language in Nepal. 


Therefore, Nepali brands will continue to rely on Indian influencers who can fluently speak and understand the language. 


India-based influencers from regions that are near the Indo-Nepal border will be particularly in high demand, since they are able to cater to both the Indian and Nepali markets.


## üì¢ Conclusion

Indian influencers on ShareChat are finding brand deals from Nepali brands and even garnering a massive following in the Himalayan country. 


While many brands in Nepal rely on Indian influencers who primarily create content on ShareChat due to their popularity and reach in Nepal, there is also a shortage of local influencers who can fluently speak and understand the Nepali language. 


This shortage has made Indian ShareChat influencers a hot commodity among brands in Nepal. 


According to a report by the Himalayan Times, this trend is only going to increase as more brands in Nepal look to invest in influencer marketing campaigns. 


Moreover, as India and Nepal share a deep cultural connection, Indian influencers will continue to find great traction with audiences in Nepal.
