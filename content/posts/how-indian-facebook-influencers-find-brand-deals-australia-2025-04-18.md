In a world where the reach and influence of digital platforms know no boundaries, Indian Facebook influencers and content creators are proving to be adept at securing brand partnerships from across the globe. Countries like Australia are hot on their radar, with enticing opportunities for collaboration and market penetration. 

This article delves deep into the strategies employed by Indian influencers to snag lucrative deals from Australian companies, offering priceless insights that will help you craft your own approach.


## üí° Why Influencers Are Targeting Australia

A considerable number of Facebook influencers from India are focusing their attention on Australia for brand collaborations as they offer a wealth of opportunities. 

Brands looking to establish or enhance their footprint in India are searching for innovative ways to do so. Turning to the social reach of local influencers has become a popular go-to, especially since the organic audience engagement rates typically surpass traditional advertising.

This mutual interest is driven by several factors. A burgeoning Indian diaspora in Australia has paved the way for marketing and business development efforts aimed at them and in a way that resonates with local culture and customs. 

Furthermore, the Facebook marketing landscape across India has matured significantly. As a result, influencers and creators have honed their skills and expertise to build authentic connections with audiences. Still, the Indian Union boasts over 300 million Facebook users, making it a strategic market for Australian brands looking to tap into.


## üìä Who Are These Influencers?

Many influencers from India are well-known in their home country and possess a solid following among its citizens based in Australia. The ones looking to grab these brand partnership opportunities likely fall into one of these categories: 

- **A-class influencers** typically secure partnerships with high-end luxury brands. They are known for their ability to create aspirational content with a high degree of brand integration.  
  - For example, Babolat India recently partnered with tennis influencer Nitin Dange in a social media collaboration for their 2025 campaign. Nitin has a solid following among tennis enthusiasts in Australia.

- **B-class influencers** actively work with a variety of mid-tier brands. They are known for approaching brand campaigns with the mindset of a fan so their content resonates as authentic and relatable. 
  - Aiming to influence Indian audiences living in Australia, a B-class influencer such as Tanya Roopa is a promising candidate for brands looking to penetrate that market. Tanya often shares her experiences and opinions about Indian cuisine and beauty products, thus establishing a solid connection with overseas audiences.

- **C-class influencers** focus on niche topics with a loyal audience. Their audiences often comprise highly engaged consumers that are interested in specialized subjects such as products or services. 
  - For instance, sports influencer Rajesh Shaktivel switched to full-time content creation after experiencing immense online success in fitness and nutrition. His expertise and experience can provide immense value for Australian brands.

This is just a small sampling of the various types of influencers from India looking to establish brand collaborations with Australia. Each influencer‚Äôs unique attributes and strategies will be covered in more detail later, but it‚Äôs important to note the distinction these categories present. 


## üìà How Are Influencers Finding Brand Deals?

While some of the tactics employed by Indian influencers mirror those of their counterparts from other countries, there are some that are unique to the Indian culture and social customs. 

One of the most pertinent strategies involves building relationships with marketing agencies and platforms that facilitate influencer marketing. 

#### Marketing Agencies

Agencies specializing in influencer marketing are typically the go-between brands and influencers. They source influencers for campaigns based on criteria set by their clients that include audience demographics, engagement rates, and previous brand collaborations. 

One influencer agency that bridges Indian influencers with Australian brands is **Baskit**. The agency partners with both Indian and Australian influencers to create unique and innovative marketing solutions that drive measurable results for brands. 

According to their website, Baskit works closely with influencers to build their unique brand identities, enhance their credibility, and expand their influence. This helps them secure brand deals more easily and facilitates the endorsement process for brands looking to partner with desirable influencers.

#### Influencer Platforms

Unlike marketing agencies, platforms don‚Äôt offer personalized services. Nonetheless, they are valuable tools that facilitate influencer marketing for many creators. 

Platforms such as **WooHoo** operate as directories that allow brands and influencers to connect with one another independently. 

Influencers can register on platforms and create profiles that highlight their content niches, audience demographics, and previous brand partnerships. These profiles are visible to brands that can then contact influencers directly to negotiate potential collaborations. 

Since brands can browse profiles and reach out to influencers directly, they save time and money that would otherwise be spent on hiring an agency. 

#### Social Networking 

Many influencers are leveraging social media platforms to secure brand deals. Instagram and Facebook groups dedicated to influencer marketing discussions are common in India. 

One of the more popular groups is **Influencer Marketing India**, boasting a solid fan base of over 67,000 members. Created back in 2019, the group has been instrumental in helping influencers secure brand partnerships as well as assisting brands with influencer discovery. 

Groups like this empower influencers to connect with one another and share insights, tips, and even leads on promising collaborations. 

#### Outreach

While other Indian influencers are relying on marketing agencies, platforms, or social networking groups to find brand deals, some have taken matters into their own hands. 

For instance, C-class influencer Sarita Rathi actively reaches out to brands for collaboration opportunities. Self-described as a genuine influencer that supports startups through digital marketing, she has effectively carved a niche for herself in the influencer marketing ecosystem. 

Her approach has empowered other aspiring influencers to do the same, as she often shares her outreach templates to inspire others to craft their messages. Sarita claims that she has secured several brand deals through outreach alone, even with high-ticket brands.

#### Conclusion

Influencers from India have a plethora of tools, strategies, and tactics available to them for securing brand deals. The Indian influencer marketing landscape is still on the rise, with influencers wanting to solidify their positions as top performers. 

Seeking brand collaborations with Australian companies is just one of the avenues they are pursuing to achieve that goal.


## ‚ùó Risks of Working with Influencers

The burgeoning influencer marketing space in India is still rife with challenges. Brands must exercise due diligence to ensure they partner with reputable and trustworthy influencers. 

One of the biggest hurdles is identifying fake influencers. Many influencers have inflated their follower counts and audience engagement rates by employing various black-hat techniques such as using bots, purchasing followers, and engagement pods to manipulate performance metrics. 

Partnering with a fake influencer can ruin a brand‚Äôs reputation and waste marketing budgets. According to a Forbes article, brands that fall for fake influencers can expect to lose upwards of $500 million annually. 

Brands can employ several methods to spot fake influencers, such as using influencer marketing platforms that provide analytics. These platforms can give insights into follower counts, audience demographics, engagement rates, and previous brand collaborations. 

Additionally, brands can conduct their own analysis. For instance, they can study the engagement levels of an influencer‚Äôs posts to spot discrepancies. If an influencer has tens of thousands of followers but only receives a few likes and comments, this could raise red flags. Brands can also read through comments to spot spammy posts like ‚ÄúI love your page, please check my profile‚Äù which indicate that an influencer may have fake followers.
