TikTok is not just a platform for silly dances and lip-syncs anymore; it has become an integral part of marketing strategies for businesses and brands around the world. With over 1.1 billion users in 2022 and millions of them being from India, it's clear that TikTok cannot be ignored, especially in the Indian market. 

If you want to scale your brand and increase your business growth in India, you must utilize TikTok for business marketing and influencer collaborations. 


# Why TikTok Marketing in India is Important for Business Growth

While TikTok is now banned in India, for the purpose of this article, we will assume it is still operational within the country.

The TikTok audience in India is the largest in the world, with a whopping 437 million users. That’s about a third of the entire Indian population. 

The Indian audience is also predominantly young. About 60% of TikTok users in India are between the ages of 16 and 24. This means that brands aiming to reach Gen Z and young millennials should prioritize TikTok influencer marketing in India.

Using TikTok for business marketing in India helps increase brand awareness, attract new customers, and improve customer engagement and loyalty. 


# How to Use TikTok for Business Marketing in India

Using TikTok for business marketing and influencer collaborations in India requires a solid strategy. Below are some practical tips to help you effectively leverage TikTok for your brand. 


## Identify Your Target Audience

If you want to be successful in your TikTok business marketing efforts in India, you must know your target audience. 

A good way to learn about your audience is to do your research and find out which Indian TikTok influencers are already using your products or services. 

Once you know who your audience is, you can start producing relevant content that resonates with them, leading to increased views, likes, and follower growth. 


## Create Engaging Content

TikTok is all about fun and creativity. If you want your TikTok marketing content to succeed in India, you must develop entertaining videos that keep your audience amused and engaged. 

Using popular sounds, memes, and trending hashtags can help make your content stand out from the competition and reach a wider audience. 

Avoid being too promotional. Instead, focus on creating entertaining and authentic videos that tell a story and connect with your audience emotionally. 

You can also leverage user-generated content (UGC) by encouraging your audience to share their videos featuring your products. 


## Collaborate with Indian TikTok Influencers

One of the best ways to market your products on TikTok is by collaborating with TikTok influencers in India. 

These influencers have a massive following on the platform, and their audience trusts their opinions. So when they promote your products, their audience is likely to check them out.

However, when searching for Indian TikTok influencers for collaboration, prioritize quality over quantity. Look for influencers with high engagement rates and a relevant audience that aligns with your brand. 

The following are some of the top Indian TikTok influencers you can collaborate with for your TikTok marketing campaigns.

1. **Aashika Bhatia** - 43.5 million followers.
2. **Nisha Guragain** - 39 million followers.
3. **Faisal Shaikh** - 36.1 million followers.
4. **Awez Darbar** - 30 million followers.
5. **Jannat Zubair Rahmani** - 28.6 million followers.


## Run TikTok Ads

You can also run ads on TikTok to reach a wider audience and improve your brand visibility. 

You can create your ads using the TikTok Ads Manager. You only need to sign up as a marketer, set a budget, and create your ads. 

TikTok ad options include:

1. **In-Feed Ads** - These ads appear in the user’s ‘For You’ feed. You can direct viewers to your website or your TikTok profile.
2. **Top View Ads** - These ads grab the viewer's attention as soon as they open TikTok. They can last for up to 60 seconds, giving you enough time to convey your message.
3. **Branded Hashtag Challenges** - These ads encourage users to create content based on your brand’s concept. This leads to user-generated content that promotes your brand and helps it go viral.
4. **Branded Effects** - You can design filters, stickers, and special effects that promote your brand. TikTok users can then use them in their videos and share them with their audience.


## Measure Your Success

Finally, don’t forget to measure your TikTok marketing success. 

Use TikTok analytics to track your account’s performance, including views, likes, shares, and follower growth. 

You can also use external tools to measure the performance of your influencer campaigns, ads, and overall marketing efforts on TikTok. 

Analyzing your performance will help you identify areas for improvement and grow your TikTok presence.  


# Conclusion

If you want to do business in India, you must use TikTok for marketing and influencer collaborations.  

Doing so will provide you with immense opportunities to scale your business and gain a competitive edge over your rivals.
