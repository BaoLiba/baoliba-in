Indian Snapchat influencers are making a name for themselves in Vietnam, a country that is completely different from India. They are working hard to earn lucrative brand deals from local companies to expand their portfolios.

The influencers often share their experiences of getting paid to promote Vietnamese brands. Their work spans all aspects of influencer marketing, from local fashion to tech gadgets. They are currently focused on social media platforms that are popular in Vietnam.

The influencers also frequently post about how they look and act like Vietnamese people. They say that their apparent Vietnamese identity helps them stand out on Snapchat in a country that has a large number of influencers.

There are a few reasons why Indian Snapchat influencers are trending in Vietnam.

## üìà The rise of Snapchat in Vietnam

Snapchat has increased in popularity in Vietnam in recent years. According to a 2023 survey by Statista, Snapchat has overtaken Facebook as the leading social media platform in Vietnam in terms of daily active users.

In 2023, 30 percent of Vietnamese internet users aged 16 to 64 reported using the platform daily. The platform surpassed Instagram and TikTok, which came in second and third, respectively, with 26 and 23 percent of daily active users.

In 2025, Snapchat is projected to have 50 million users in Vietnam, up from 39 million in 2023. The increase will be an incredible year-on-year growth rate of 14.49 percent, a figure that is more than double that of the next most popular platform, Facebook, which is growing at a rate of only 5.8 percent.

Snapchat's meteoric rise in Vietnam has led to a surge in demand for Snapchat influencers, as brands look to capitalize on the platform's growing user base. While Vietnamese influencers are stepping up to the plate, they are being challenged by foreign influencers, particularly from India.

## üé≠ Standing out as Vietnamese

To compete with local influencers, Indian Snapchat influencers must adopt Vietnamese identities. They do so by dressing like Vietnamese people, speaking Vietnamese, and even claiming to be Vietnamese.

Many of the influencers claim that they are of Vietnamese descent, even if they cannot name a single Vietnamese ancestor. They also state that they are fluent in Vietnamese, even if they cannot speak the language.

The camouflaging is working. Indian Snapchat influencers are receiving requests from Vietnamese brands that believe they are Vietnamese.

For example, Snapchat influencer B·∫£o Ho√†ng claims that he is from S√†i G√≤n. In reality, he is Ravi Kumar, a Snapchat influencer from India.

Despite having a Chinese name, B·∫£o Ho√†ng is a proud Indian who prefers to identify as Vietnamese. Wearing a traditional Vietnamese outfit known as an ao dai, he promotes various Vietnamese brands, including beauty products, fashion items, and even real estate. He offers his promotional services to brands in Vietnam that are looking for influencers.

## üí∞ Lucrative brand deals

Promoting brands on Snapchat can be highly lucrative for Indian influencers. Influencers can make between $400 and $700 for a single sponsored post on Snapchat, which is significantly more than what they can make on other platforms.

The amount an influencer earns per post can vary based on their follower count, engagement rate, and the type of content they create. Influencers with larger followings and higher engagement rates can command higher fees for their sponsored content.

For example, if they have 1 million followers and a 10% engagement rate, they might charge $700 per post. An influencer with 100,000 followers and a 5% engagement rate, on the other hand, might charge $400 per post.

Given that the average cost of a sponsored post in India is only $200, Indian Snapchat influencers have found a great opportunity in Vietnam.

## üåè The rise of Indian Snapchat influencers in Vietnam

The presence of Indian Snapchat influencers in Vietnam is likely to continue to grow. Snapchat is becoming more popular in the Vietnamese digital landscape, and Indian influencers are rising to the challenge.

The influencer trend is predicted to continue until at least 2025. Industry experts expect Snapchat to surpass all other social media platforms in the region, which will lead to a greater demand for Snapchat influencers, especially foreign influencers.

As a result, Indian Snapchat influencers will have a larger share of the influencer marketing pie. They will likely see their brand deals increase, as they are often more affordable than local influencers.

## üì¢ The trend is international

The rise of Indian Snapchat influencers in Vietnam is not an isolated phenomenon. Influencers from India, and also other countries, are increasingly venturing into foreign markets to find lucrative brand deals.

In the Philippines, where Snapchat is currently the top social media platform, Indian Snapchat influencers are also making a name for themselves. They promote brands that are popular in the Philippines while posing as Filipinos.

Indian Snapchat influencers have also gained traction in Japan. They promote Japanese brands while pretending to be Japanese. 

## üîç The hotbed of influencer marketing

Vietnam is a hotbed for influencer marketing and is expected to remain one through the years. According to a report by PR Newswire, the influencer marketing segment in Vietnam is projected to grow at a rate of 27.36 percent from 2021 to 2026.

The country is home to more than 25 million influencers from various social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and now Snapchat. Despite the large number of influencers, influencer marketing is set to grow.

As Vietnam continues to become a global leader in influencer marketing, the presence of Indian Snapchat influencers is likely to grow even more.
