In 2023, over 64% of Vietnamese citizens are on Instagram, making it the second most-used social media platform in the country. For Indian influencers looking to expand their brand deal portfolio, Vietnam poses a lucrative opportunity.

According to a report from Statista, Instagram is projected to have 37.85 million users in Vietnam by 2025. For Indian Instagram influencers looking to capitalize on this growth, partnerships with Vietnamese brands will be critical.

With the right strategies, Indian influencers can work with Vietnamese brands. Here‚Äôs how they‚Äôre doing so.


## üìà Vietnam: A Growing Market for Indian Influencers

As India moves towards a $5 trillion economy, the country‚Äôs role as a global player is cemented. According to the World Bank, India‚Äôs per capita income is expected to triple between 2021 and 2031. 

With rising incomes comes growing consumerism. A report from the Indian Brand Equity Foundation estimates that Vietnam will become the largest consumer market in Southeast Asia by 2030. 

In Vietnam, consumerism is extending beyond just its citizens. The influx of tourists has pushed demand for consumer goods. In 2022, Vietnam‚Äôs retail sales growth was the highest in Southeast Asia, at 10.5% year-on-year. 

According to a 2022 report from the Vietnam National Administration of Tourism, the country welcomed 3.67 million foreign arrivals in 2022, exceeding government targets by 23%. 

While the number of Indian tourists remains modest, travelers from other nations have already driven demand for Vietnamese products such as cosmetics, apparel, and digital services. 

Indian influencers with an established presence in Vietnam can leverage this growing consumer market for brand deals.


## üë©‚Äçüíª How Indian Influencers Are Getting Brand Deals in Vietnam

To gain access to brand partnerships with Vietnamese companies, Indian influencers are pursuing various strategies. Here are the top three ways they‚Äôre succeeding.

### 1. Expanding Their Reach

According to a report from Instagram, 58% of Vietnamese users said they discover new products on the platform. For Indian influencers, this provides a unique opportunity to reach Vietnamese brands looking for exposure.

In 2023, Indian beauty influencer Disha Patil traveled to Ho Chi Minh City to promote the Vietnamese skin care brand Clochee. With over 173,000 followers on Instagram, Patil used her platform to showcase Clochee‚Äôs products.

‚ÄúVietnamese beauty products are the best in the world,‚Äù said Patil after her trip. ‚ÄúThey smell nice, hydrate your skin, and leave no oily residue. I‚Äôll be coming back for more.‚Äù

Disha Patil promoted the Vietnamese brand Clochee to her 173,000 followers on Instagram. 

For Indian influencers to attract Vietnamese brands, they must appeal to a wider audience. Using targeted hashtags such as #Vietnam and #VietnameseBeauty can help influencers achieve this. 

### 2. Leveraging Local Talent

Collaborating with local Vietnamese influencers is another effective strategy for Indian influencers looking to get brand partnerships. 

According to a survey from the US Department of Commerce, 75% of Vietnamese consumers say they trust local influencers more than global ones. 

In 2025, Indian influencer Himani tweeted about her trip to Vietnam alongside local influencer Thao pham. The two influencers collaborated to promote popular tourist destinations and Vietnamese products. 

‚ÄúAlways good to meet Indian sisters abroad and feel at home!‚Äù tweeted Thao pham. ‚ÄúHappy to befriend and host Himani in Vietnam.‚Äù

Local influencers can introduce Indian influencers to Vietnamese brands looking for exposure. 

### 3. Working With Vietnamese PR Agencies

By partnering with Vietnamese public relations firms, Indian influencers can gain access to a growing number of brand deals in Vietnam.

In December 2023, Indian influencer Chetan Bhadana announced a partnership with the Vietnamese PR agency Vietstar Media. With over 28 million followers on Instagram, Bhadana is known for sharing comedic videos on his social media platforms. 

‚ÄúVietnam is a beautiful country, and being there is a great honor,‚Äù said Bhadana in a post announcing the partnership. ‚ÄúI am proud to be representing Vietnam in India and other countries.‚Äù

In 2025, Vietnamese PR firms will likely engage in more collaborations with Indian influencers. By working with these PR firms, Indian influencers can secure endorsement deals with Vietnamese brands.
