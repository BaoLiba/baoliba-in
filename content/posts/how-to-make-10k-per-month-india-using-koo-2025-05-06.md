## üí° How Influencer Marketing Works on Koo in India

Unlike conventional platforms, Koo‚Äôs influencer marketing has a distinct flavour:

### Real example: Take ‚ÄúNamaste Shalu‚Äù from Lucknow, who grew her regional food blog on Koo to 70K followers by May 2025.

## üìä Step-by-Step to Hit ‚Çπ10 Lakh Monthly on Koo

Forget chasing millions. Pick your niche and language, like Marathi tech news or Punjabi fashion tips. Consistency is king here ‚Äî post 2-3 times daily with trending hashtags and keywords.

### 2. Create Engaging, Native Content

Koo‚Äôs users love authenticity. Use polls, memes, and short videos. Being funny or relatable in your regional language can boost shares and followers fast.
