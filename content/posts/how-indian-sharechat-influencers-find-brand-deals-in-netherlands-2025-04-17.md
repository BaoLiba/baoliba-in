## ⚏ How Indian ShareChat influencers find brand deals in Netherlands?

- **Pitching to brands**: Influencers need to be proactive and directly reach out to brands they want to partner with. 
- **Personal networking**: Influencers can network with brand representatives and marketing agencies at events or through social media. Staff members at Dutch brands may also have ties back to India.
- **Using influencer marketing platforms**: There are many platforms out there that can connect brands and influencers directly to streamline the process.


### 💬 Direct Pitching to brands

Cold pitching is the most traditional method and works for many influencers.

And there’s no way Dutch brands won’t love the idea of Indian influencers advertising their brands in India.

So influencers can start with a simple email introducing themselves and what they can offer the brand.

But sometimes cold pitching can go unanswered.

In those cases, they should resort to having a Dutch friend help them skip the line.


### 🎤 Personal Networking

Many Indian influencers already have friends in foreign countries and that can be valuable.

They can ask them to introduce them to friends who work for Dutch brands or even to the brands themselves.

Whether it’s Instagram or ShareChat, networking is still the best way to get gigs.


### 📩 Influencer marketing platforms

Once influencers are done pitching, they should also consider signing up for influencer marketing platforms such as BaoLiba.

These platforms are run by professionals, and they do the client acquisition for you.

Brands can simply visit the platform and browse through the many influencers until they find a suitable fit.

It’s a win-win for everyone.


## 🔏 Payment methods for Indian ShareChat influencers on brand deals in Netherlands

When it comes to how Indian influencers can get paid for their brand deals with Dutch brands, they have many options.

They can accept payments through Paypal, TransferWise, or directly through international wire transfers.

#### 🔑 PayPal

PayPal is by far the easiest and most popular method of receiving payments online.

It’s fast, secure, and there’s no fuss.

The influencer provides the brand with their email address linked to their PayPal account, and they can receive payments in any currency.


#### 👔 TransferWise

TransferWise has been around for a while and is another great option.

They make transfers across borders easy and cheap.

They charge a small fee to send and receive funds and they promise to convert the funds at the real exchange rate.

And they don’t have a limit on how much money can be sent.


#### 🔓 International bank wire transfers

Many brands, especially bigger brands, have the option for wire transfers in their banking system.

And that is a reliable and safe way for influencers to receive payments.

Brands will need the influencer’s account details such as the name, address, branch address, and account number.

But it may take a while for the funds to clear in the influencer’s account, especially when it crosses borders.


## 🍉 ShareChat influencer marketing best practices

- **Create eye-catching thumbnails and video covers**: Thumbnails are the first thing users see and should pique their curiosity.
- **Leverage relevant hashtags**: Popular hashtags help influencers gain visibility since they lead to ranking on ShareChat feeds.
- **Engage with viewers in the comments**: Fans love influencers who notice their comments and love to interact with them.


### 📷 Create eye-catching thumbnails and video covers

The thumbnail is the most important part of getting clicks.

If a thumbnail is dull, boring, or unprofessional, it won’t grab anyone’s attention.

But if it’s colorful, inviting, and intriguing, users will want to click it.

Influencers can use free tools such as Canva or Snappa to create custom thumbnails.


### 📈 Leverage relevant hashtags

Hashtags are essential to getting influencer videos seen on ShareChat.

They help categorize the influencer’s videos so they can be found easily by users interested in that topic.

Influencers need to do their research and find relevant hashtags.

And they should use a mix of popular hashtags and niche-targeted hashtags.

This will ensure they reach audiences looking for specific content.

But they should avoid using too many hashtags since ShareChat may flag them as spam.


### 💬 Engage with viewers in the comments

It’s important for influencers to reply to as many comments as they can.

This shows they appreciate their fans, and it helps drive more engagement.

People love talking to influencers they love, and it can create loyal fans.

Also, it provides insightful feedback on the influencer’s videos and what they can improve on.


## ✅ ShareChat influencer marketing legal considerations for Dutch brands

- **Ensure influencer adherence to advertising standards**: The Dutch Advertising Code dictates the obligations of influencers.
- **Confidentiality agreement**: Brands must protect their trade secrets and confidential information.
- **Content licensing agreement**: Brands buy the rights to use the influencer’s content in their marketing across platforms.


### 👮 Ensure influencer adherence to advertising standards

Dutch law requires influencers to clearly disclose if they have received a benefit from brands in exchange for promotion.

Influencers can do it best by saying “ad” in their video descriptions. 

Brands should educate influencers about this legal obligation to prevent potentially damaging consequences.


### 🔐 Confidentiality agreement

Social media is not a private medium.

Brands risk losing a competitive edge if trade secrets or other sensitive information leaked from influencers’ videos.

A confidentiality agreement should specify how confidential information will be handled, when it is permitted to disclose it, and the consequences for violations.


### 📝 Content licensing agreement

This agreement determines how and when brands can use influencer content.

Dutch brands need to be clear with influencers about how their content will be used, whether it be for ads, websites, or other purposes.

They should also specify how long the influencer’s content can be used. This is important if brands want to create ads that involve influencer videos.


## ⚖️ Legal reasons why ShareChat influencers need contracts for brand deals in Netherlands

Having a contract protects influencers from being taken advantage of by brands.

Also, it legally binds brands to any agreement they make with influencers.

Without contracts, influencers may not get paid or brands may misuse their content.


### 🧾 To protect against non-payment by the brand

Contracts are legally binding, and if brands don’t fulfill their end of the deal, influencers can bring them to court.

That puts a lot of pressure on brands to ensure they do what they say they will do.


### 💿 To protect the influencer’s content from being misused by the brand

Influencers should understand how their content will be used by brands.

Otherwise, they risk their content being misused and damaging not only their reputation, but also their followers’ trust.


### 🏢 To ensure the brand is aware of any influencer advertising regulations

Contracts allow brands to understand what is expected of them.

This includes any advertising standards, deadlines, deliverables, exclusivity agreements, and disclosure practices.

If brands don’t adhere to the contract, influencers can take legal action and sue them.
