In a world where the digital landscape is always changing, Indian influencers are always finding new ways to get brand deals. One of the most recent and possibly the most interesting avenues they are taking involves the country of Nepal and the Indian social media app, Moj.

While Indian influencers have been known to procure brand deals in other parts of the globe, perhaps nowhere is so intriguing as Nepal. In this article, we‚Äôll explore how Indian Moj influencers are finding brand deals in Nepal.


## üìä What‚Äôs Moj?

Launched in 2020, Moj is India‚Äôs version of TikTok that was developed by the company, ShareChat. It quickly gained popularity, surpassing 1 billion downloads after launching.

Moj is a video-sharing platform that allows people to create, share, and discover short video content. It has been hailed as one of India‚Äôs most significant social media platforms, with over 200 million active monthly users.

In fact, its rapid rise in popularity saw it garner 100 million downloads within just six months of launching, and it has also received investment from notable companies like Google.

As with other social media platforms, the popularity of Moj is indicative of a user‚Äôs ability to engage with the content of others on the platform.


## ‚úàÔ∏è Why Nepal?

As governments erect digital borders to keep foreign influencers out, Indian influencers are becoming more and more inventive. And Nepal is as close as it gets to a foreign territory without being too distant.

Nepal is a country that closely resembles India. They share a history, culture, and religion that ties them together in both significant and minor ways. This makes it a perfect target for Indian influencers.

According to a 2022 report, Instagram usage in Nepal is quite high, with 80% of the 2.5 million Instagram users in the country accessing the platform daily. This means that influencers, especially Indian influencers, have a solid market to sell to as they try to procure brand deals.

However, while most influencers are using Instagram to find brand deals in Nepal, Indian influencers are primarily using the Moj platform.


## üì± How do Indian influencers in Nepal use Moj?

Using Moj to find brand deals in Nepal is surprisingly simple. Most Indian influencers do not even reside in Nepal. Rather, they simply travel to Nepal for a few days and set up shop.

Once there, Indian influencers set about creating content for the Moj platform that is specific to their target audience in Nepal. Once that is done, they post the content and wait for the views to roll in.

So what kind of content are Indian influencers creating on Moj that is geared towards the Nepalese audience? The short answer is most of the content is Indianized and stereotypical.

In fact, when Moj influencers travel to Nepal, much of the content they create consists of them doing basic, everyday things, but with an exaggerated twist.

For example, Indian influencers might film themselves shopping in stores or eating in restaurants while exaggerating their facial features and body language.


## ‚ùó What are the challenges faced by Indian Moj influencers in Nepal?

Despite the ease with which Indian Moj influencers can find brand deals in Nepal, there are challenges that they face.

Indian influencers have been known to face harassment in Nepal. In fact, a report highlighted how a group of Indian influencers were arrested by police in the Bhaktapur area who accused them of offending local culture.

As a result, they were forced to delete the videos they created that were critical of the local culture. Many locals were offended by the content that the Indian influencers created, leading to protests and harassment.

Despite the challenges, the lucrative market for brand deals in Nepal has continued to attract Indian Moj influencers to the country.


## üöÄ How do Indian Moj influencers get brand deals in Nepal?

When Indian Moj influencers travel to Nepal, they usually already have brand deals lined up. This is because the majority of those brand deals are facilitated by talent agencies.

There are several talent agencies that have emerged in India with the express purpose of connecting Indian Moj influencers with brands in Nepal and making it easier for them to get brand deals.

One example is the Indian talent agency known as, Social Star. According to them, they primarily connect Moj influencers with brands in Nepal. Their services help Indian influencers get brand deals in a variety of niches, including travel, technology, and health.


## üì¢ Are Indian Moj influencers in Nepal affecting local influencers?

The rise of Indian Moj influencers in Nepal is reportedly affecting local influencers. In particular, it seems to be affecting their ability to get brand deals.

According to local influencers, the rise of Indian influencers in Nepal and how they are using Moj to find brand deals is forcing them out of business. They have expressed their frustration in online posts, especially in posts on Instagram.

One local influencer lamented that Indian influencers are ruining their market by getting all the brand deals. They claim that Indian influencers are stealing their ideas and that they don‚Äôt even have to face the repercussions of their actions as they usually leave Nepal shortly thereafter.

Local influencers have called on the Nepali government to find a way to regulate the activities of Indian influencers in the country. They want to ensure that they are given priority over Indian influencers when it comes to getting brand deals in Nepal.


## üôå What does the future look like for Indian Moj influencers in Nepal?

As long as there are regulations that prevent brands in India from associating with Indian influencers in India, Indian Moj influencers will continue to find brand deals abroad, including Nepal.

On the other side, this means that local influencers are going to continue to struggle to get brand deals as they compete against Indian influencers who are often seen as more talented than them.

This is not only true for Nepal as many countries are facing a similar problem. For example, talent agencies in Thailand are facing a similar challenge with Indian influencers.

In the immediate future, it looks like Indian Moj influencers are going to continue to enjoy the lucrative market that Nepal presents them.

In fact, By 2025, it is expected that there will be an even larger number of Indian Moj influencers in Nepal and the majority of brand deals will continue to go to them.


## üí° Conclusion

It is quite interesting how the Indian social media landscape is evolving to accommodate the needs of their influencers who are seeking brand deals abroad.

Moj influencers are finding lucrative brand deals in Nepal, but local influencers are suffering as a result. While this is surely good news for Indian influencers, there‚Äôs no telling how long they will be able to enjoy this lucrative market.
