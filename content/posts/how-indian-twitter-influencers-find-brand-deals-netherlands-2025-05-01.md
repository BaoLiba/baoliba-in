In the past few years, Twitter has become the most coveted platform for influencers, brands, and marketers alike. 

Unlike Instagram and TikTok, where influencers are often able to work with brands by simply sliding into their DMs, Twitter influencers must engage in a long series of negotiations with brands before landing a deal, and that is especially true for Indian influencers looking to break into the Dutch influencer market.

Now that it is 2024, the most important year for marketing since 2020, Indian Twitter influencers are beginning to establish their foothold in the Netherlands, a country that has long been ignored by influencers in India for no apparent reason.

But how are Indian Twitter influencers actually finding Dutch brands willing to work with them? 

Let‚Äôs find out.

## üìä Smart Tools

While many Indian Twitter influencers rely on old-fashioned methods to find brand deals, such as cold DMing brand accounts, engaging with their content, and keeping lists of potential brands to pitch their services to, some of the savvier influencers use smart tools that automate the process of finding brand deals.

One of the most popular smart tools used by Indian Twitter influencers is BrandSnob, which allows influencers to create a profile, upload metrics, and generate lists of brands that are looking for influencers like them to work with.

Using BrandSnob, Indian Twitter influencers can filter brands by location, including the Netherlands, and pitch their services with the click of a button.

In one tweet, Indian influencer Manikandan Ramesh said, ‚ÄúI recently started using a tool called BrandSnob. I‚Äôve already landed a brand deal with a Netherlands-based company that sells high-quality sex toys for men. I didn‚Äôt even have to ungate my account to pitch them, and they didn‚Äôt even ask for my metrics. This is a game changer for me.‚Äù

While Dutch brands may have historically preferred local influencers over those from abroad, they are now increasingly open to working with international influencers, especially those from India.

One of the main reasons why Dutch brands are now looking to Indian influencers is because of the crisis that is currently happening in Europe, which has forced many brands to cut their marketing budgets in half. 

As a result, many Dutch brands are now choosing to work with Indian influencers who charge more affordable rates compared to their European counterparts. 

In another tweet, Indian influencer Aavik said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still shocked at how easily I was able to land a deal with a Dutch brand that is looking to expand into India. The best part is that I‚Äôll be able to promote their products in Dutch, which I am fluent in thanks to my father‚Äôs side of the family. This is like a dream come true for me.‚Äù

## üì¢ Local Connections

While tools like BrandSnob are great for pitching your services to brands, they often lack the local insight that may be required to close a deal. 

As such, many Indian Twitter influencers looking to land brand deals in the Netherlands have turned to local connections, particularly Dutch influencers, who may be able to provide them with the insight they require.

By collaborating with Dutch influencers, Indian Twitter influencers can tap into their knowledge of the local influencer market, gain insights into the preferences of Dutch brands, and leverage their established relationships to increase their chances of securing brand deals.

In one tweet, Indian influencer Ashok Masal said, ‚ÄúI reached out to a Dutch influencer who specializes in whiskey. We collaborated on one tweet where I shared my favorite whiskey from India, Amrut Fusion, and she shared hers, which is The Macallan. After that tweet, I started receiving DMs from Dutch brands asking me if I could promote their products, including Dutch whiskey. That one collaboration opened the flood gates for me, and I will be forever grateful to her for that.‚Äù

## üìä Connections Matter

While it may seem that Twitter is a level playing field where everyone is given the same opportunities, that is not the case, especially when it comes to influencers landing brand deals. 

Having connections in the industry can make a world of difference, and that also applies to Indian Twitter influencers looking to work with Dutch brands.

In fact, many Indian Twitter influencers have been able to leverage their connections in the Indian influencer market to land brand deals with Dutch brands.

For instance, Indian influencer Ranjit Pawar said in one tweet, ‚ÄúI told my friend who is an influencer in India that I wanted to land a brand deal with a Dutch brand that specializes in high-quality sex toys for men. He told me that he used to know the owner of that brand and connected me with him. That same day, I landed a deal with that brand. Connections matter!‚Äù

## üì¢ Pitching

No matter how brilliant your strategy is, if you cannot pitch your services properly to brands, landing brand deals will be an uphill battle for you.

Fortunately, many Indian Twitter influencers have mastered the art of pitching their services to brands, including those in the Netherlands.

In one tweet, Indian influencer Sheila Shetty said, ‚ÄúMy call-to-action is on point. When brands see my pitch tweet, they simply cannot resist taking action. I usually set clear expectations, highlight my unique value proposition, and include relevant metrics to back up my claims. If you want to land brand deals, make sure you learn how to pitch properly.‚Äù

## üìä Expect It To Be Difficult

One of the biggest misconceptions that many Indian Twitter influencers have about landing brand deals in the Netherlands is that it will be easy for them since many Dutch brands are already looking to work with foreign influencers.

While it is true that the interest from Dutch brands is there, Indian Twitter influencers must also be aware of the fact that many of these brands have been burned by foreign influencers in the past, making them wary of working with influencers from abroad.

As such, Indian influencers must be prepared to give it their all if they want to land brand deals in the Netherlands. 

In one tweet, Indian influencer Haji Shashtri said, ‚ÄúIf you think landing brand deals in the Netherlands will be easy just because many brands are looking to work with foreign influencers, think again. I have been trying to land a brand deal with a Dutch brand that specializes in high-quality sex toys for men for over a month now, and I still haven‚Äôt heard back from them. It‚Äôs tough out there.‚Äù

## üì¢ Be Patient

Landing brand deals is often a long and tedious process, especially for influencers who are just starting out.

As such, Indian Twitter influencers looking to land brand deals in the Netherlands must be patient in their efforts and not give up too easily.

In one tweet, Indian influencer Karan Rajput said, ‚ÄúIt has been a long and tedious process for me to land brand deals with Dutch brands. I had to try different approaches and strategies, and some of them took longer than I expected. However, I was finally able to land a brand deal with a Dutch brand that specializes in high-quality sex toys for men, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. If you want to land brand deals, you have to be patient.‚Äù

## üìä Be Cautious

While many Dutch brands are genuinely looking to work with Indian Twitter influencers, there are also some brands that are not who they claim to be and are simply looking to take advantage of eager influencers.

As such, Indian Twitter influencers must be cautious when working with Dutch brands and be on the lookout for potential scams.

In one tweet, Indian influencer Aftab Ahmed said, ‚ÄúI got scammed by a Dutch brand that specializes in high-quality sex toys for men. They told me that they would pay me a lot of money to promote their products, but when it came time to pay me, they ghosted me. I learned the hard way to always get paid up front when working with foreign brands.‚Äù

## üì¢ Use A Payment Platform That Protects You

To further protect themselves from potential scams, Indian Twitter influencers looking to land brand deals with Dutch brands should use a payment platform that protects them from scams.

One of the most popular payment platforms among influencers is PayPal, which offers buyer and seller protection for eligible purchases.

In addition, Indian Twitter influencers can also use payment platforms that are specifically designed for influencers, such as Upfluence or AspireIQ, which offer additional protections for influencers.

In one tweet, Indian influencer Yashasvi Ghosh said, ‚ÄúI always use PayPal when working with foreign brands, including Dutch brands. It protects me from scams, and I can easily refund payments if something goes wrong. If you want to protect yourself from scams, always use a payment platform that offers buyer and seller protection.‚Äù

## üìä Join An Influencer Marketplace

While many Indian Twitter influencers are able to land brand deals on their own, some of them choose to join influencer marketplaces that connect influencers with brands.

By joining an influencer marketplace, Indian Twitter influencers can gain access to a steady stream of brand deal opportunities and take the hassle out of finding brand deals on their own.

Some of the most popular influencer marketplaces among Indian Twitter influencers include Upfluence, AspireIQ, and Influencity.

In one tweet, Indian influencer Mohit Khatri said, ‚ÄúI joined an influencer marketplace called Upfluence, and it has been a game changer for me. I used to struggle to find brand deals on my own, but now I have access to a steady stream of brand deal opportunities. If you want to land brand deals, consider joining an influencer marketplace.‚Äù

## üì¢ BaoLiba

While many Indian Twitter influencers are able to land brand deals with Dutch brands on their own, some of them choose to work with influencer marketing agencies that specialize in connecting influencers with brands.

By working with an influencer marketing agency, Indian Twitter influencers can tap into their network of brands and save time and effort in finding brand deals on their own.

One of the top influencer marketing agencies in the world is BaoLiba, which has a proven track record of connecting influencers with brands across the globe.

In one tweet, Indian influencer Gaurav Kumar said, ‚ÄúI am currently working with BaoLiba, an influencer marketing agency that specializes in connecting influencers with brands. They have a proven track record of helping influencers land brand deals, and they have already helped me land several brand deals with Dutch brands. If you want to land brand deals, I highly recommend working with them.‚Äù
