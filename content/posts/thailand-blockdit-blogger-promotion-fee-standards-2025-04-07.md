So, youâ€™re looking for Blockdit influencers in Thailand to partner with for your next promotional campaign, right? Well, youâ€™ve come to the right place.

In this article, we will outline the Thai Blockdit influencer landscape as well as the different prices they charge for promotional collaborations.

## ðŸ“Š What is Thai Blockdit?

Blockdit is a social media platform that is quickly gaining traction across Southeast Asia, especially in Thailand, where it was launched back in 2019.

The platform allows users to post text and images, much like a blog, but with a focus on community engagement. Users can create pages, follow each other, and up-vote or down-vote posts, similar to Reddit.

If youâ€™re like most casual internet users, this may sound foreign to you. Rest assured this is not a platform for you.

Blockdit was designed for people looking for high-quality content and discussions. 

User-generated content on the platform covers various topics, including current events, politics, health, travel, and food.

Because of this, a large portion of the user base is educated professionals looking for substance, meaning the platform has a much higher quality audience than most social media platforms.

Also, unlike most social media platforms which are dominated by youth, the average age of users on Blockdit is 35 years old, skewing even higher in Thailand, where the average user is over 40 years old.

## ðŸ“¢ Thai Blockdit Users Love Following Influencers 

When you consider how difficult it is to get Thai people interested in advertising and influencer content, itâ€™s quite remarkable that Blockdit has become home to a large number of Thai influencers.

Influencer marketing is huge in Thailand, and according to research conducted by the influencer marketing agency Timpl, 66% of Thai users follow influencers online.

When asked for the top reasons they follow influencers, 40% of users said they follow them for lifestyle inspiration, and 38% said they follow them for product recommendations. 

In addition, Blockdit is a trusted platform for many Thai influencers, as 74% of them believe Blockdit has a lower risk of fake followers compared to other platforms.

## ðŸ“¢ Collaboration Pricing for Thai Blockdit Influencers 

There are many factors influencing the price that Thai Blockdit influencers charge for promotional collaborations, but here are some average prices that we found recently:

- Text Post: 15,000 to 30,000 Thai baht

- Text Post + Video: 45,000 to 90,000 Thai baht
- Sponsored Replies: 5,000 to 10,000 Thai baht

Most Thai Blockdit influencers charge a fixed price depending on what type of post they are creating. 
They also charge higher prices for sponsored replies, as this feature is not available to everyone.
