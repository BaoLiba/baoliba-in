The rapidly growing Indian influencer market is a hotbed for brand deals. However, while many homegrown influencers are predominantly working with brands within their country, some have ventured beyond India‚Äôs boundaries to find new brands to collaborate within different countries. 

This article will show how ShareChat influencers are being hired by brands in South Korea to promote their products and services, and how they can do it too.

## üìä Data Insights

According to research conducted by ShareChat, 74% of Korean brands want to work with Indian influencers, and 78% of marketing agencies in South Korea want to work with Indian influencers too. 

The study is backed by ShareChat‚Äôs consistent efforts to connect Indian influencers with brands from South Korea. Although there are currently 9 lakh influencers on ShareChat, it is unclear how many of them have successfully worked with South Korean brands.

## ü§î Why Korean Brands Want to Work with Indian Influencers?

There are a number of reasons why brands in Korea want to collaborate with Indian influencers.

### 1. More visibility in the Indian Market

Historically, Korea has been known for its K-Pop music and young fashion trends. Recently, brands from Korea have been wanting to expand their businesses into other countries, particularly India.

By partnering with Indian influencers, brands from Korea can significantly boost their visibility in the Indian market, leading to an increase in sales.

### 2. Uniqueness

Another reason many Korean brands want to work with Indian influencers is the uniqueness they bring.

Korean influencers are predominantly promoting Korean brands. Thus, brands from Korea that partner with Indian influencers will stand out from their competitors who are also promoting Korean brands.

By doing so, they will increase the chances of gaining new customers who had never heard of or tried their products before.

### 3. Existing Fan Base

Many Indian influencers have already built a large fan base, especially those on ShareChat. By collaborating with them, Korean brands can leverage their existing audience. 

Based on research from ShareChat, around 89% of Indian influencers on ShareChat have supported the Korean wave. They are already familiar and connected with Korean culture, thereby making these influencers ideal for promoting Korean brands.

## üìà Growth Stats

The growth rate of brands hiring Indian influencers on ShareChat to promote their products and services in Korea has been phenomenal. 

In 2022, 8 Korean brands enlisted the services of influencers from ShareChat to promote their brand. In contrast, so far in 2023, 65 Korean brands have partnered with ShareChat influencers.

This indicates a remarkable growth rate of 812.5%, which has led the platform to predict that it will reach 150 Korean brands by the end of this year.

## üí° Practical Tips 

Below are some practical tips for Indian influencers on how to partner with brands from Korea to promote their products and services.

### 1. Create Content Related to Korea

The first step for influencers to partner with Korean brands is to start creating content related to Korea. Influencers can create content about Korea or make content that exhibits their appreciation for Korean culture. 

For instance, influencers can create content related to K-Pop, Korean skincare, and K-dramas. 

By doing so, Korean brands will discover them and reach out, or they could also reach out to Korean brands themselves.

### 2. Register on a Global Influencer Marketing Platform

The second step is for influencers to register themselves on a global influencer marketing platform. These kinds of platforms help businesses find influencers to promote their products and services. 

There are many influencer marketing platforms, but it is best to choose one that is especially popular among Korean brands. One such platform is BaoLiba.

## ‚ùó Risk Reminder

Despite the lucrative opportunities for Indian influencers to partner with Korean brands, they should still be extremely careful when doing so.

### 1. Language Barrier

One of the main barriers that Indian influencers should be aware of when partnering with Korean brands is the language difference. 

While many Koreans can speak English, there is still a gap in comprehension. Therefore, both parties should be very clear in their communications to avoid misunderstandings.

### 2. Payment Methods

Another barrier Indian influencers need to watch out for is the payment method. 

There are several payment methods that are widely accepted around the world and in Korea, such as Paypal and bank transfers. However, some Korean brands may only accept payment methods that Indian influencers are not able to facilitate. Therefore, it is best for influencers to discuss payment methods with Korean brands beforehand.

### 3. Legal Differences

Before entering into a partnership with Korean brands, Indian influencers should also be aware of the different legalities between India and Korea. 

Both countries may have different laws regarding influencer marketing regulations, including different advertising guidelines and intellectual property rights. 

To minimize the potential risk of encountering legal problems, influencers should research the laws concerning influencer marketing in Korea.
