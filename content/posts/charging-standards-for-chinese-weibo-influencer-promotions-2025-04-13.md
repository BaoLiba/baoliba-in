China's Weibo is a social media platform that has become extremely popular with Chinese millennials and is quickly taking off with the younger generations. 

With over 580 million active users, China’s microblogging site Weibo is a prime platform for influencer marketing. 

Weibo influencers have broken into the mainstream. Weibo is considered the best platform for Chinese marketing experts and influencers, due to its sway and history.


Unlike many western social media platforms, Weibo is fully integrated into the Chinese economy. 

Thus, ad agencies and companies looking to market their products via influencer marketing are well aware of what they’re up against. 


Weibo charges “微信” (WeChat) fees and requires ID verification from both businesses and influencers before any transactions can take place.


This means payment through traditional channels like PayPal and direct bank transfers isn’t possible like in the West. 


Weibo has earned a reputation as a platform where influencers are able to easily sell merchandise using influencer marketing.

Because of this, companies are flocking to influencers for marketing collaborations. 


Popular Weibo influencers can charge anywhere from 25,000 to 2,000,000 Chinese yuan (3,500 USD to 320,000 USD) for a simple post or video. 


Prices vary according to the industry and level of influence. 


Popular Weibo influencers can attract tens of thousands or even millions of likes per post.


Companies like Swire Properties and China Mobile have collaborated with Weibo influencers to promote their products using innovative campaigns.
 


Luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and Gucci also collaborate with Weibo influencers to promote their products. 


Luxury brands know this is effective because the average annual salary in China as of 2022 is only $12,000. 


Hence, only 25% of the Chinese population can afford luxury products.


Thus, luxury brands rely heavily on Weibo influencers to entice and market their products to the affluent. 


Weibo influencers who gain the attention of luxury brands can be lucrative gold mines, raking in hundreds of thousands per social media post or video.


While popular French influencer agencies like The Influence Agency and S4M can charge upwards of 23,000 euros for micro-influencer campaigns, Weibo influencer agencies charge a mere 3,000 euros for similar campaigns. 


This makes Weibo influencers extremely competitive against their western counterparts.


While prices can be steep, hiring Weibo influencers to market products is cheaper compared to other marketing channels.


Advertising rates in China increased by 4.3% to 5.2% in 2022. 


Compared to traditional advertising channels, the increase for influencer marketing is substantially lower.


Prices vary by influencer tier.


Micro-influencers can charge as little as $600 per post or video.


While the average mid-tier influencer can charge $5,000 for solid sponsorship deals.


Top-tier influencers can charge at least $30,000 per post.


Weibo influencers have built a powerful reputation for getting products in front of the right people and increasing brand awareness. 


Chinese marketing expert and fashion influencer 官微 known as 'Guan Wei' on Weibo has over 4 million followers and has collaborated with over 1,000 brands.


Guan Wei primarily markets fashion designer label products but extends his promotional services to skincare and cosmetics brands as well.


Weibo influencer agency W3E has worked with over 350 premium brands.


W3E Weibo influencer agency helps brands and companies find suitable Chinese influencers to promote their products.


China is no different from any other country regarding the success of influencer marketing.


After all, beauty and fashion products remain to top categories brands and companies want influencers to promote. 


According to a report published by the National Bureau of Statistics of China in July 2021, the total revenue of China's cosmetics market exceeded 400 billion yuan (62 billion USD) in 2020.


Female beauty influencers comprised 58.7% of Weibo influencers in 2021.


While male beauty influencers only comprised 18.4%.


Fashion influencers were only a tiny part of the mix, comprising roughly 8.6% of Weibo influencers. 


But their impact can be invaluable as males comprise a substantial part of the Chinese luxury market spending 68% of the total.


Beauty influencer Guan Wenqian has made a name for herself as the founder and creator of the ‘Get Nose Bloated’ beauty routine that went viral on Weibo.


Guan Wenqian has been featured in major media outlets like BBC and The Independent for creating the beauty routine that millennials have flocked to try.


Guan Wenqian primarily focuses on beauty and cosmetics products and collaborates with several brands.


Guan Wenqian is also an ambassador for Uber, overalls brand Dungarees, and other companies.


Guan Wenqian charges a commendable 10,000 yuan (1,500 USD) for paid posts. 


While the average Weibo influencer earns a respectable $366 a day, top-tier influencers can earn a jaw-dropping $1 million per post.


Japan and South Korea’s beauty and makeup products have long been popular in China.


Thus, it’s no surprise that Weibo influencers are the go-to marketing gateway for Japanese and Korean beauty products.


Top Japanese beauty influencers can charge at least 1 million yen (6,500 USD) per post.


While Japanese beauty influencers charge around $1,500 to $450,000 for their marketing services.


Beauty influencers charging upwards of 600,000 yen (4,100 USD) are not uncommon.


Korean beauty influencers also charge upwards of $100,000 for their marketing expertise.


They can even charge $10,000 just for a beauty makeup tutorial. 


Beauty and style influencer Gina Wanda has over 3 million followers on Weibo.


Gina Wanda collaborates with several brands and is a prominent ambassador for the Chinese campaign entitled, “Makeup Is Not a Mask.”


Gina Wanda is known as the ‘Queen of Weibo.’ And charges upwards of 20,000 yuan (3,000 USD) for paid posts. 


While the average Weibo influencer can charge anywhere from 3,000 to 30,000 yuan (450 to 4,500 USD) for a simple post.


Weibo beauty influencers have made a name for themselves as China boasts the fastest growing beauty market in the world.


The Chinese beauty market grew by 66% from 2015 to 2020.


This rapid growth is due to millennials and Gen Z consumers who will comprise 90% of the market by 2030.


Thus, it’s imperative for brands and companies to stay ahead of the curve and regularly collaborate with Weibo beauty influencers for marketing efforts.


The age of the average Weibo influencer is 28 years old.


Young adults aged between 21 and 35 years old are the mainstream influencers, comprising 62.7% of Weibo influencers.


Those aged between 15 and 20 years old make up 17.4%, while influencers aged between 36 and 40 years old comprise 11.9%.


Weibo influencers over 40 years old are a rare breed, comprising only 7.2%. 


This proves that most Weibo influencers are young adults targeting consumers the same age or slightly younger.


While the number of Weibo influencers is a fraction compared to other social networks, their impact is monumental.


Weibo influencers can deliver impressive returns on investment ranging from 4 to 20 times, with an average of 7.6 times.


Thus, the significant price increase for influencer marketing has been inevitable.


Although the market expects a steady increase in the number of Weibo influencers, it still remains incredibly competitive. 


Just as supply and demand dictate, the prices for Weibo influencers will likely increase as the 2025 deadline approaches.


As the price of Weibo influencers climbs, those looking to market their products via influencer marketing should capitalize now. 


The time to act is now! Brands and companies should get ahead of the curve and secure solid influencer deals before the price rush. 


The next five years promise to be monumental for Weibo influencers. 


Those who wait to seize this wonderful opportunity will be left in the dust.
