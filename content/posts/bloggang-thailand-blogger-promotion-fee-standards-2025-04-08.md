When it comes to influencer marketing in Thailand, Bloggang is a major contender for brands who want to reach Thai consumers.

It's important to know how much Bloggang influencers charge for collaborations so that brands can budget accurately when launching campaigns with these influential bloggers.

Blogging is serious business in Thailand and Bloggang is a professional blogging community with its own social network, offering a means for members to conduct author-driven commerce.

According to the 2022 Thai Social Media Impact study published by the Digital Economy Promotion Agency (DEPA), Bloggang is the top blogging platform in Thailand and the second most popular social media platform after Facebook.

Over half of the study's respondents said they routinely search for blogs before deciding to buy products advertised in them.

With that in mind, let‚Äôs delve into how much Bloggang influencers charge for marketing collaborations.


## üí∞ Pricing Overview of a Bloggang Influencer

The factors that influence how much a Bloggang influencer charges for a sponsored post include:

- Audience engagement¬†
- Audience demographics
- Experience and reputation

Bloggang influencers charge anywhere from $50 to $1,500 for a sponsored post according to a blog titled How Much Do Bloggers Charge For Sponsored Posts? on the Influencer Marketing Hub.

Yet another blog that delves deeper into the various rates for blog sponsorships states that bloggers with less than 10,000 monthly unique visitors charge an average of $75 per post while those with more than 100,000 charge an average of $500 per post.

Meanwhile, according to a post on the Thai Webhosting Blog, Bloggang influencers can charge anywhere between 3,000 to 20,000 Thai Baht for sponsored content.


## üë®‚Äçüíª Types of Collaboration

The two most common types of sponsored content Bloggang influencers produce are product reviews and tutorials.

Influencers who specialize in product reviews receive samples of products in exchange for writing a review about them on their Bloggang blog.

In tutorial posts, the influencer explains how to use a product while demonstrating its use.

Tutorial posts require more effort than product reviews and therefore tend to cost more.


## üí≥ Payment Methods

The most common payment method used by Bloggang influencers for sponsored content collaborations is bank transfer.

Several other payment methods are also popular including:

- PayPal
- Credit card
- Cheque

However, not all influencers accept all payment options. This is why brands should check with influencers beforehand to avoid last-minute inconveniences.


## üìä Monetization Methods

Bloggang influencers monetize their blogs in various ways besides publishing sponsored content. Other monetization methods include:

- Affiliate marketing
- Display advertising
- Selling products and services related to the niche

Those who use affiliate marketing earn a commission on sales that they generate through their blog posts.

They place tracking links in their posts that are unique to them. When a reader clicks on the link and makes a purchase, the influencer gets paid a commission from the retailer.

Display advertising works in the same way, only those ads are paid for on a cost per click basis. Each time someone clicks on the ad, the influencer earns money.


## üìà Blog Engagement Statistics

Engagement statistics show how well Bloggang influencers connect with their audience. Here are some key statistics that brands should pay attention to:

- According to Similar Web, Blogang receives 4.8 million monthly visits.
