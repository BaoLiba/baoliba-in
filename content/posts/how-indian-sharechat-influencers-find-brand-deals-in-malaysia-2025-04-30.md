In 2025, ShareChat influencers in India will be the go-to marketing channel for Malaysian businesses looking to reach the Indian diaspora in Malaysia.

But how do these influencers find brand deals? 

Let‚Äôs take a closer look.

## üìä The ShareChat Opportunity 

In Malaysia, the Indian diaspora is approximately 2 million, or 7.5% of the country's total population. 

According to the Malaysian Indian Congress, the Indian community is the largest minority in Malaysia.

Despite being the largest minority in Malaysia, Malaysian Indians lack representation in politics and economic opportunities, and they earn lower salaries than their Malay and Chinese counterparts.

However, recent studies show that Malaysian Indians have a strong affinity for Indian culture, including music, film, food, religion, and fashion. 

They are also more likely than the Malay or Chinese Malaysians to prefer Indian products and consume Indian media.

This means that Malaysian Indians are a ripe audience for Indian brands seeking to expand into Malaysia.

ShareChat is India‚Äôs leading short video social media platform and the preferred choice for Indian influencers.

It is ranked as the 14th most popular social media platform globally, with over 400 million monthly active users, and it has the highest market penetration in India of any social media platform.

ShareChat is also the fifth largest app in India in terms of user time spent per day, with each user spending an average of 31 minutes per day on the app.

ShareChat has over 60% of its users in rural India, meaning that influencers on ShareChat represent a huge segment of the Indian population that is often overlooked by marketers.

In addition, ShareChat has recently launched an influencer marketing platform called ShareChat for Brands that helps brands connect with influencers to create sponsored posts for their products or services.

This platform will help Malaysian businesses tap into the power of ShareChat influencers in India to reach the Indian audience in Malaysia.

## üì¢ The ShareChat Influencer Ecosystem 

The ShareChat influencer ecosystem is vast, with over 35 million creators on the platform.

Creators can earn money in diverse ways, such as through the ShareChat Creator Fund, gifts from users during live broadcasts, and by selling their own merchandise.

However, the majority of the revenue earned by ShareChat creators comes from brand deals.

In fact, 90% of ShareChat influencers earn more than INR 10,000 per month from brand deals alone.

As Malaysian brands try to break into India, they can expect to pay anywhere from USD 50 to USD 500 for a sponsored post on ShareChat from an influencer with over 50,000 followers.

Brands can also expect to pay between USD 200 to USD 800 for a sponsored video on ShareChat that has the potential to reach millions of users.

The amount paid for a sponsored post or video on ShareChat will depend on the number of followers a creator has, as well as the creator's niche and engagement rate.


## ü§ù How ShareChat Influencers in India Find Brand Deals

As the Indian diaspora in Malaysia grows, more and more Indian influencers are interested in breaking into Malaysia.

Naturally, they would want to help Malaysian businesses reach this valuable audience.

In addition, they will want to build their own brand as someone with influence in Malaysia, which will strengthen their reputation and opportunities for brand deals in India.

As such, Indian influencers on ShareChat can expect to find brand deals from Malaysian businesses through the following ways:


### üì© 1. Influencer Marketing Platforms

Influencer marketing platforms connect brands with influencers looking for brand deals.

These platforms allow influencers to create profiles and showcase their work, making it easier for brands to find the right influencer for their marketing needs.

Brands can search for influencers based on various criteria, such as audience demographics, engagement rates, and niche.

Once a brand finds an influencer they want to work with, they can reach out to them through the platform and negotiate the details of the brand deal.

### üîç 2. Networking on Social Media

Social media is a powerful tool for influencers looking for brand deals.

By building a strong presence on social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, influencers can attract the attention of brands looking for influencers to partner with.

Brands often search for hashtags related to their products or services to find influencers who are already using or promoting their brand.

Influencers can also reach out to brands directly through social media messaging to inquire about potential brand deals.

### üìß 3. Email Outreach

Email outreach is another effective way for influencers to find brand deals.

Influencers can create a list of brands they want to work with and send them personalized emails proposing a collaboration.

In their emails, influencers can showcase their work, audience demographics, and engagement rates to convince brands to work with them.

### üë©‚Äçüíª 4. Direct Contact

Some brands may reach out to influencers directly for a brand deal.

This can happen through social media messaging, email, or even phone calls.

For example, a Malaysian restaurant owner may discover an Indian influencer on ShareChat who regularly promotes Indian cuisine.

The restaurant owner may contact the influencer to propose a collaboration, such as a free meal in exchange for a review on ShareChat.

### üíº 5. Brand Reps

Many influencers have become brand representatives for various brands.

As brand reps, influencers are responsible for promoting the brand's products or services on their social media platforms.

They may receive free products, discounts, or even a commission for each sale made through their referral link.

Having brand reps is a win-win situation for both brands and influencers.

Brands get increased exposure and sales, while influencers earn money and free products.

### üí∞ 6. Brand Ambassadors

Brand ambassadors are similar to brand reps, but they usually have a longer-term partnership with the brand.

Brand ambassadors are often chosen for their alignment with the brand's values and target audience.

They are expected to represent the brand positively and authentically.

In exchange for their commitment, brand ambassadors may receive a salary, free products, and other perks.

### üìà 7. Public Relations Firms

Public relations firms often work with brands to help them find influencers for brand deals.

These firms have established relationships with influencers and can connect brands with the right influencer for their marketing needs.

Brands may hire a PR firm to handle their influencer marketing efforts, allowing them to focus on other aspects of their business.

### üì£ 8. Word of Mouth

Word of mouth is one of the oldest forms of marketing, and it still works today.

Influencers can find brand deals through word of mouth by networking with other influencers, attending events, and joining online communities.

For example, an Indian influencer on ShareChat may attend a conference in Malaysia and meet another influencer who works with a Malaysian brand.

The Malaysian influencer may refer the Indian influencer to the brand for a potential collaboration.


## üì¢ The Future of ShareChat Influencers in Malaysia

As the Indian diaspora in Malaysia continues to grow, Indian influencers will have ample opportunity to find brand deals from Malaysian businesses. 

Currently, there are over 1.82 million Malaysian Indians who are active on Facebook. 

This means that Malaysian Indians are the most active ethnic group on Facebook compared to Malay and Chinese Malaysians.

Since ShareChat is the leading social media platform in India, Malaysian brands looking to reach the Indian population in Malaysia will turn to ShareChat influencers.

The Malaysian Indian community is reported to watch more Indian films than other ethnic groups in Malaysia. 

They also have a preference for Indian restaurants and Indian food, with more than 37% of Malaysian Indians consuming Indian food daily.

They also have a preference for Indian products, with 60% of Malaysian Indians indicating a preference for Indian-made products.

This indicates that Malaysian Indians are a valuable audience for Indian brands looking to break into Malaysia.

In 2025, Malaysian brands can expect to shell out a lot more than the current USD 50 to 800 for an influencer marketing campaign on ShareChat.

With the right strategies, Malaysian brands can leverage ShareChat influencers to tap into this lucrative market.

## ‚ùó Final Thoughts

As the largest minority group in Malaysia, the Indian community represents a valuable audience for Indian brands looking to expand into Malaysia.

ShareChat influencers from India are well-positioned to tap into this lucrative market.

With the right strategies, Malaysian brands can leverage ShareChat influencers to reach Malaysian Indians effectively.
