If you are an influencer in India, you are probably confident in the competitive pricing of your influencer marketing collaborations across multiple social platforms.

But if you are an Indian marketing executive seeking influencer collaboration in Thailand on a platform like Sanook, you are in for a surprise.

Thai influencers on Sanook charge often less than half what Indian influencers would expect for similar collaborations.

While the prices may be lower than you are used to, that doesn't mean that Thai influencers are any less skilled at what they do.

In this article, I will help you navigate the nuances of influencer collaboration rates on Thai platforms like Sanook, as well as give you tips on how to create profitable influencer marketing partnerships there.

## üíµ Pricing Strategy

A study conducted in China found that 82% of influencers are willing to lower their price when working with a foreign brand. 

While this finding may not be true for all Asia-Pacific influencers, the pricing for influencer collaborations in Thailand is generally more attractive for foreign brands, as evidenced by the ease at which most Thai influencers will negotiate their rates.

### üó£Ô∏è Influencer Rates

The rates that influencers charge vary depending on various factors, including follower counts, engagement rates, content types, and target markets. 

For Sanook influencers, the typical rates are as follows:

- **Sanook Micro-influencer (1-10K followers):** ‚Çπ2,000 to ‚Çπ5,000 per post.

- **Sanook Mid-tier influencer (10K-100K followers):** ‚Çπ15,000 to ‚Çπ30,000 per post.

- **Sanook Macro-influencer (100K+ followers):** ‚Çπ60,000 to ‚Çπ100,000 per post.

These prices are well below what similar Indian influencers would charge.


### üìù Collab Types

The specific type of collaboration also plays a large role in influencer pricing on platforms like Sanook.

- **Post only:** The influencer will charge less for a single post than they would for a full campaign or multi-post collaboration. Expect to pay around 25% less for this type of post.

- **Story only:** If the influencer has a large following on their social stories, they may charge a premium for this type of post. Expect to pay around 15% more for a story-only collaboration.

- **Campaign:** This is a full-blown influencer campaign, and rates will depend largely on the type of content produced, as well as deliverables.

## üí≥ Payment Methods

Thai influencers tend to be more open to various payment methods than their Indian counterparts.

- **Direct payments:** Thai influencers tend to charge around 15% less when working with a foreign brand that can pay them directly without the use of an influencer marketing platform. 

- **Platforms:** If influencers cannot accept direct payments, they often use popular platforms as a middleman. 

Some of the most popular payment platforms among Thai influencers include:

- PayPal
- TransferWise
- Western Union

While these platforms are common in India as well, influencers from India may insist on being paid directly.

## üì± Local Preferences

While your Indian marketing team may decide to work with local Thai influencers on Sanook, be sure to remember that not all social platforms are equal in Thailand. 

Sanook is one of Thailand's most popular websites, making it a great platform for local influencers looking to reach those domestically. 

However, consider that most of the world's major social media platforms are also very popular in Thailand as well. 

- Thai influencers are also active on international platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, which has grown to be one of the top social platforms in Thailand. 

- Depending on your campaign goals, it may sometimes be more effective to engage with influencers from Thailand on international social media platforms as opposed to local sites.

## üîç Search Engines

Thailand is a top market for influencer marketing as a whole. 

In 2025, the Thai influencer marketing market is expected to reach $320 million, which is up from $189 million in 2022.
