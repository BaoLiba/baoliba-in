In recent times, South Korea has rapidly emerged as a prime destination for Indian influencers across various social media platforms, primarily Snapchat. This trend has witnessed an influx of Indian Snapchat influencers undertaking travels to South Korea, the Land of Morning Calm, with the intent of sealing lucrative brand deals.

In fact, Snapchat has emerged as the preferred social media platform for Indian influencers traveling to South Korea over its counterparts, Instagram and TikTok. This is primarily attributable to the platform's irresistible premium rates that South Korean brands are willing to pay for influencer marketing promotions.

Indian influencer marketing platform, Baoliba, specializing in cross-border influencer marketing services spanning over 100 countries, has closely monitored the evolving trend of Indian influencers penetrating the lucrative South Korean influencer marketing space in 2023 and into 2025.


## üì¢ The Impact of the Korean Wave among Indian Youths 

The Korean Wave phenomenon has rapidly gained traction over the years, especially among Indian youths who have developed a strong affinity for Korean culture, trends, music, dramas, and fashion. Consequently, this growing obsession has sparked an interest among Indian females for South Korea.


As a result, Indian influencers, particularly female Snapchat influencers, have seized the opportunity to travel to South Korea to capitalize on the burgeoning obsession and establish a stronghold within the influencer marketing ecosystem.

A prime example of this trend is Indian influencer and online sensation Sakshi Sindwani, a major Indian influencer who gained fame for her fashion and lifestyle content. Sindwani successfully clinched a lucrative deal with a South Korean beauty brand during her visit to South Korea. She delivered an engaging Snapchat story showcasing her exploring the breathtaking sights of South Korea, complete with a captivating voiceover. 


Her brand deal, valued at 50,000 rupees, was indicative of the high-paying opportunities available for Indian influencers, particularly on Snapchat, which South Korean brands find enticing due to its ephemeral nature.

## üí° The Appeal of Snapchat to South Korean Brands

According to reports, Snapchat has gained tremendous popularity in South Korea, with a staggering 12 million monthly active users and a penetration rate of 23% among teens and 25% among individuals aged 20 to 30 years, which is higher than that of Instagram.

This paradigm shift among the youth demographic in South Korea can be attributed to the platform's innovative features, such as augmented reality and dynamic sticker functions, which align well with the preferences of the youth.

Furthermore, Snapchat's unique selling proposition lies in its ephemeral content format, where images and videos remain visible for only 24 hours. The platform enables users to share events with a sense of spontaneity reminiscent of personal interactions. As a result, Snapchat's ephemeral messaging is less likely to lead to misunderstandings and awkwardness compared to other platforms.

In line with the growing affinity of South Korean youth towards Snapchat, South Korean brands have recognized the platform's potential for influencer marketing, consequently redirecting their marketing budgets from Instagram and TikTok towards Snapchat.


## üéØ Snapchat Influencer Marketing Budgets Surge among South Korean Brands

Indeed, the recent trend in South Korea indicates that Instagram is gradually losing its top position in influencer marketing to Snapchat.

According to a report published by Korean public relations firm, Persona, 40% of local marketing professionals prioritize Snapchat as their preferred platform for influencer marketing campaigns. In contrast, Instagram and TikTok now account for only 28% and 21% of marketing budgets, respectively.

Korean firms are increasingly collaborating with influencers on Snapchat due to the platform's unique interactive features. Unlike its competitors, Snapchat automatically delivers 100% views on advertisements, ensuring effective consumer engagement.

Furthermore, Snapchat's young user base, with a majority aged between 13 and 34, aligns perfectly with the target demographics of businesses in the beauty, travel, fashion, F&B, and automotive sectors.

According to Persona, 73% of South Korean influencers have also asserted that they will continue to invest more of their resources into Snapchat, while 69% expressed that Instagram has become increasingly tedious compared to earlier times when they initially gained popularity on the platform.

Consequently, 49% of influencers in South Korea will now prioritize Snapchat over Instagram for their influencer marketing activities.

## üöÄ How Indian Snapchat Influencers Are Landing Deals in South Korea

News has spread throughout South Korea that Indian influencers have risen to prominence in their influencer marketing scene, particularly on Snapchat. The rising popularity can also be attributed to the Bollywood film, "Employee of the Month," which prominently featured an Indian influencer showcasing stunning footage of South Korea, eventually securing influential status and brand deals upon returning to India.

To successfully land brand deals in South Korea, Indian influencers initially explore local influencer marketing agencies specializing in cross-border services. Baoliba has emerged as a reputable marketing agency known for connecting Indian influencers with lucrative brand deals in South Korea.

For instance, one of Baoliba's clients, Indian actress and model, Ridhima Tiwari, secured two major brand deals in South Korea with K-Beauty and food brands, amounting to over 150,000 rupees.

According to Ridhima Tiwari, "Baoliba provided all the necessary tools for me to secure these brand deals in South Korea. The digital influencer marketing agency goes out of its way to help Indian influencers land brand deals in South Korea and other countries too."

## üìù Requirements for Indian Influencers to Secure Brand Deals in South Korea

Baoliba has reported a significant increase in requests from Indian influencers seeking brand deal opportunities in South Korea since early 2023.

One of its executives revealed that Indian influencers must adhere to certain requirements when targeting brand deals in South Korea.

First and foremost, influencers are required to possess a Snapchat account with a minimum of 10,000 followers. Additionally, they must have a captivating portfolio showcasing previous brand deal experiences, along with various strategies they plan to implement when collaborating with brands.

Baoliba also utilizes AI technology to analyze influencers' social media accounts. As a result, those who have a history of purchasing fake followers or engaging in unethical tactics will be excluded from consideration. Moreover, influencers will have to bear their travel costs, which can amount to approximately 100,000 rupees, depending on the duration of their stay in South Korea.

Nevertheless, influencers can expect to earn between 50,000 and 100,000 rupees per brand deal secured during their trip. In fact, some influencers have even reported earning up to 200,000 rupees from a single brand deal.

According to Baoliba's executive, many Indian influencers are currently pursuing brand deals in South Korea, and some have already secured lucrative contracts. By 2025, at least 500 Indian influencers are expected to have entered the South Korean influencer marketing space, primarily focusing on Snapchat influencer marketing.

## üí° Conclusion

As the Korean Wave continues to captivate Indian youths and their fascination for all things Korean grows, Indian influencers will be more than willing to embark on transnational escapades to South Korea to secure brand deals and boost their earnings.
