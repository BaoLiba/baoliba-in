While many Indian influencers are gaining traction in Europe or the Americas, few are aware that their fellow influencers from ShareChat are pioneering influencer marketing in Brazil.

In fact, ShareChat influencers have already made a name for themselves in Brazil, where they are booked for lucrative deals via Brazilian agencies, local media reported.

## üìà Is ShareChat popular in Brazil?

More than 400 million people use ShareChat in India, making it one of the most popular social media platforms in the country.

With more than 100 million monthly active users, ShareChat is also Brazil's fastest-growing social media platform, according to local media reports.



In November 2023, the app was reported to have surpassed 10 million monthly active users, a 130% increase from 2022, when it registered 4.3 million monthly active users.

In Brazil alone, more than 19 million people downloaded ShareChat in 2022, making it the most downloaded app in the country for that year, according to local reports.

## üìä Is ShareChat popular among influencers in India?

The app is also popular among influencers in India, where it boasts more than 30 million content creators and influencers across a variety of categories.

With an average time spent on the app of more than 31 minutes daily, ShareChat influencers typically generate three times the engagement of other influencers on platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram, and YouTube.


According to local media reports, the app's Indian influencers are also noticing a demand for their services from Brazil-based brands.

A 2025 report published by Forbes Brasil revealed that Brazilian agencies are increasingly seeking the help of Indian influencers to promote their brands in Brazil.

In fact, some Brazilian agencies are reportedly booking Indian influencers for marketing campaigns worth millions of rupees.

‚ÄúWe are increasingly receiving requests from Brazilian agencies seeking to book Indian influencers for Brazilian marketing campaigns,‚Äù said Amit Agrawal, founder of the Indian influencer marketing agency Phonethics.

## üí° Why are Indian influencers favored in Brazil?

Local reports reveal that Indian influencers are favored over local Brazilian influencers because they can reach a wider audience at a fraction of the cost.

While a Brazilian influencer may charge BRL 2,000 (INR 32,000) to produce a single sponsored post for Instagram, an Indian influencer can do the same job for as low as BRL 200 (INR 3,200), a local media report revealed.

Some Indian content creators can even produce a sponsored post for as low as BRL 20 (INR 320), which is 100 times cheaper than what a local influencer would charge.

In addition to being cost-effective, Indian influencers boast a high engagement rate and the ability to produce high-quality content.

‚ÄúIndian influencers are proving to be a better option for Brazilian brands because they can get the job done and they don‚Äôt charge an arm and a leg for it,‚Äù Agrawal said.

## üéØ What are the factors driving Indian influencers to Brazil?

Another reason for the increasing demand for Indian influencers in Brazil is that the Brazilian influencer marketing landscape has been relatively stagnant.

With more than a million influencers in Brazil, the market has become saturated, with influencer fees skyrocketing while engagement rates plummet.

In contrast, the Indian influencer marketing ecosystem is teeming with creativity, with influencers constantly experimenting with new formats and trends.

More importantly, Indian influencers are more capable of producing high-quality content at a lower cost than their Brazilian counterparts, which has made them attractive to Brazilian brands.

## ü§ù How do Indian influencers collaborate with Brazilian brands?

According to Agrawal, Indian influencers are often booked for Brazilian marketing campaigns through Brazilian agencies.

One such agency is VAI, which specializes in connecting influencers from emerging markets with international brands.

‚ÄúWe have been witnessing a growing number of Brazilian agencies turning to Indian influencers for their marketing campaigns,‚Äù Agrawal said.

‚ÄúMost of these agencies are focusing on digital marketing strategies and need content creators who can produce high-quality content quickly and at a low cost.

‚ÄúCompared to Brazilian influencers, who are currently charging high fees for low engagement, Indian influencers fit the bill perfectly,‚Äù Agrawal added.

A local media report revealed that VAI had recently booked an Indian influencer for a Brazilian marketing campaign that would see the influencer promote a Brazilian brand on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.

## ‚ùó What are the payment methods for Indian influencers working in Brazil?

Indian influencers who work with Brazilian brands typically get paid in their local currency, the Indian rupee.

However, they may also receive payments in U.S. dollars or euros, as many Brazilian brands have accounts in foreign currencies.

Indian influencers can cash in their dollar or euro payments in India through any of the many services that facilitate foreign currency exchange and remittances.

These services include Western Union, MoneyGram, and online platforms like Wise, which allow users to send money globally at a lower cost.

Brazilian brands can also use Indian banks with a presence in Brazil, such as the State Bank of India (SBI), to facilitate international currency remittances.

## üíº How do Indian influencers get paid by Brazilian brands?

In many cases, Indian influencers will only receive a portion of their payment upfront, with the remainder to be paid after they fulfill their part of the deal.

For example, a Brazilian brand wanting to book an Indian influencer may agree to pay INR 32,000 for the service. The brand may pay INR 16,000 (50%) upfront and the remaining INR 16,000 after the influencer posts the sponsored content.

In that case, the influencer may also insist on using an escrow service, which protects both parties by holding the payment until the job is completed.

In the example above, the Brazilian brand may deposit the full amount of INR 32,000 into an escrow account.

Once the influencer posts the sponsored content, the escrow service will release the INR 16,000 payment to the influencer, while the brand will receive the INR 16,000 refund back to its account.

## üìû How do Indian influencers connect with Brazilian brands?

Agrawal revealed that Brazilian agencies usually contact Indian influencers or their managers through social media direct messages or email.

In many cases, Brazilian agencies will reach out to Indian influencer marketing agencies like Phonethics, which will then refer their influencers for the job.

‚ÄúIf a Brazilian agency wants to book one of our influencers for a marketing campaign, we will first vet the agency to ensure it is legitimate and that it has the budget to pay our influencer.

‚ÄúNext, we will check in with our influencer to see if they are available for that particular campaign. If everything checks out and our influencer is on board, we will then facilitate the booking process and payment details,‚Äù Agrawal explained.

## üåé Are Brazilian brands using Indian influencers for influencer marketing?

Local media reports indicate that Brazilian brands are increasingly turning to Indian influencers for their marketing campaigns.

One such brand is ZAP Plus, a Brazilian technology company that specializes in telecommunications services.

The company recently partnered with popular Indian influencer Aashika Bhatia to promote its app, which allows users to access the internet without using mobile data.

Bhatia created a sponsored video for ZAP Plus, which she shared with her 35 million followers on Instagram and 26 million followers on TikTok.

In her promotional video, Bhatia was shown enjoying the benefits of ZAP Plus while relaxing on the beach with friends.

## üèùÔ∏è How is influencer marketing developing in Brazil?

While the Brazilian influencer marketing landscape has been stagnant in recent years, local media reports indicate that it may start to experience a revival thanks to Indian influencers.

Many Brazilian brands and agencies are realizing that they can save a lot of money and achieve better results by using Indian influencers.

In fact, a recent report published by the Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics (IBOPE) indicated that 70% of Brazilian brands intend to increase their influencer marketing budgets in 2025.

## üì¢ What are the top influencer marketing trends in Brazil?

According to the 2025 report by IBOPE, the most important influencer marketing trend for Brazilian brands is a greater focus on performance.

More than 60% of Brazilian brands indicated that they will prioritize performance marketing over brand awareness in their influencer marketing strategies.

This means that they will choose influencers based on their ability to generate measurable results, such as sales, leads, or website traffic.

Consequently, influencer marketing campaigns in Brazil will become more ROI-driven, with brands demanding more accountability from influencers.

## üé® What are the best types of influencers in Brazil?

Another important trend in Brazilian influencer marketing for 2025 is the rise of micro and nano influencers.

More than 50% of Brazilian brands indicated that they will work with smaller influencers with a more engaged audience, rather than celebrities or mega influencers with millions of followers.

These smaller influencers are seen as more authentic and relatable, and they often have a higher engagement rate than larger influencers.

As a result, influencer marketing in Brazil will become more diverse and inclusive, with a wider range of voices and perspectives represented.

## üë©‚Äçüî¨ Conclusion

In recent months, Indian influencers from ShareChat have established themselves as pioneers in influencer marketing in Brazil.

Thanks to their rise, Indian influencers are now seeing more and more lucrative brand deals come their way from the South American country.

While the trend is still in its infancy, it may soon become the gold standard for influencer marketing efforts globally.
