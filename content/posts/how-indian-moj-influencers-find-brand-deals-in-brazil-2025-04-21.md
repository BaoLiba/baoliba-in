If you think that Brazilian brands do not hire Indian Moj influencers, you are very much mistaken. In fact, Moj influencers finding brand deals in Brazil is a very normal occurrence these days. 

Over the past few months, I have come across many Hindi-speaking influencers from India, who have landed lucrative deals with brands in Brazil, as well as other South American countries. They have been going there on all-expense-paid trips, and sometimes they even get paid in Real, the official currency of Brazil! Here‚Äôs how they do it!

## üéâ Why Brazilian Brands Are Working With Indian Moj Influencers? 

With the increase in the number of Indian tourists to Brazil, more and more brands in Brazil are looking to reach out to this growing demographic. In fact, data suggests that there has been an increase of over 32% in Indian tourists arriving in Brazil, since 2019. 

Even South American countries like Chile are beginning to recruit Indian influencers to promote their brands. 

This data alone explains why Brazilian brands have started to hire Indian Moj influencers, who are fluent in Hindi, to highlight their products in the Indian market. 


## üìä How Brazilian Brands Find Indian Moj Influencers?

Though there are many ways Brazilian brands can find Indian influencers, the most well-known way is through influencers marketing platforms. 

There are many influencer marketing platforms in India, and even though they mainly cater to the Indian market, some have started to expand into the global market. 

One very popular influencer marketing platform that really focuses on the global market, especially South America, is BaoLiba. 

Many influencers from India have been able to find brand deals in Brazil, and other South American countries, simply by signing up with BaoLiba.


## üí¨ What Is BaoLiba?

BaoLiba is a global influencer marketing platform connecting advertisers with influencers. Established in 2018 in China, the platform has expanded to over 100 countries, including India, the USA, Brazil, the UK, Canada, Australia, and France to name a few. 

This platform not only offers traditional influencer marketing services, but also real-time social media monitoring and data analysis services.  BaoLiba‚Äôs unique combination of technology and human resources makes it the top digital marketing company for influencer campaigns.  

By joining BaoLiba, Indian influencers can easily connect with Brazilian brands, and vice versa.  

Moreover, unlike many of BaoLiba‚Äôs competitors, who charge hefty commissions for their services, BaoLiba charges a flat 8% fee. Even this fee can be waived for a limited time if influencers apply for a waiver. 

That‚Äôs not all, influencers can get paid in Brazilian Real when they work with Brazilian brands, or even Argentinian Peso when they work with Argentinian brands! 

This is a huge advantage for Indian Moj influencers who want to work with Brazilian brands, as they can now get paid in the official currency of Brazil. 

### üìû How To Join BaoLiba?

Joining the BaoLiba influencer marketing platform is quite simple, all you have to do is follow these simple steps:

1. Go to the official website of BaoLiba, https://baoliba.com, and click on the sign-up icon on the top right corner of the homepage. 

2. Fill in the registration form with your relevant details. Ensure that you enter accurate information. 

3. After you register successfully, you will receive a confirmation email from BaoLiba. Confirm your email address. 

4. Once you confirm your email address, you will be taken to your BaoLiba influencer dashboard. From here, you can start applying for brand collaboration campaigns with Brazilian brands in your niche. 

### üí∏ How To Get Paid By Brazilian Brands?

There are several payment options available for Indian influencers who want to get paid by Brazilian brands. The most common payment option is bank transfers. 

Brazilian brands can transfer money to Indian influencers‚Äô local bank accounts. However, they have to account for the fees charged by intermediary banks. 

Even though bank transfers can be a hassle, they are very popular payment options for many influencers due to their reliability and security. 

Other payment options available to Indian influencers who are looking to get paid by Brazilian brands include: 

- PayPal. 
- Payoneer. 
- Wise.  
- Razorpay.

### üí∞ How Much Do Brazilian Brands Pay Indian Influencers?  

Just like Indian brands, Brazilian brands pay Indian influencers depending on their promotion requirements, and the type of influencer they are. 

However, one thing is for sure, Brazilian brands pay much better than Indian brands. 

On average,  Indian influencers can earn anywhere between ‚Çπ5,000 to ‚Çπ100,000 per promotion when working with Brazilian brands. 

### üé¨ What Indian Influencers Are Doing?

When it comes to reality, it is always better to hear from those who are already in the field than rely on the opinion of someone who is not involved in what they are saying. 

In this case, I have gathered the experiences of real Indian Moj influencers who have found lucrative brand deals in Brazil. 

Here is a short video by popular Hindi-speaking influencer, Kushi Roy, who has been to Brazil and worked with many Brazilian brands:

## ‚ùó Possible Challenges Ahead

Even though the Indian influencer marketing industry is booming with growth, it also faces some significant challenges that could hinder its progress. 

One major challenge is reliability. Many Indian influencers, especially those new to the industry, tend to inflate their metrics in order to attract brands. 

For example, many influencers show fake follower counts, engagement rates, and views. Fake followers can no longer be detected as before, because social media platforms are taken down more and more. 

This has led to many Brazilian brands working with Indian influencers who do not get the expected returns. 

In fact, some Brazilian brands have even begun to blacklist Indian influencers from their marketing books. 


## üöÄ Conclusion 

Despite the challenges posed by the Indian influencer marketing industry, it is still very possible for Indian Moj influencers to safely and reliably get brand deals in Brazil. 

After all, as they say, ‚ÄúEvery problem comes with a solution!‚Äù
