Are Snapchat influencers in India networking with GPAs and TAs to land brand deals in America? 

If they aren't, they should be. 

Many influencers have been known to create their best marketing successes on their own. Influencers in India are relying on Snapchat to grow their influence and dream big. 

While many people in India still want to have their marketing done old-school, like on TV commercials, many other influencers are finding success promoting brands on the Internet.

Going viral is just a snap away with Snapchat. 

Influencers on Snapchat create their brand story in front of millions of eyeballs looking for tasty and trendy content. Become the Snapchat influencer that companies trust to deliver their brand message and make big bucks.

Growth in influencer marketing in India predicts that influencer marketing should grow 25% annually between 2022 and 2025.  By 2025, the industry in India should be worth 1.5 billion dollars. 

Isn't it time to get onboard with Snapchat influencers now?

## üì∫ TV ads will become a thing of the past

TV commercials in India have been used, but they don't work as well as they used to. 

For example, KFC wanted to make its brand relevant to the youth in India. They hired Snapchat influencers, like Aashna Hegde, to create content that communicates its brand message through relevant content.

KFC is moving to Snapchat to reach the starving youth in India. 


KFC has been featuring sponsored content on Snapchat to promote its offering and create a fashion brand image. The campaign features many fashionable influencers and fashionable Snapchat lenses.

## üí∞ Why should Indian influencers be looking for brand deals in America?

American influencers have been cashing in on their influence and creating influence brands on Snapchat for a long time. 

For example, Snapchat influencer Ryan Smith makes over 25 thousand dollars a month. He has over three million subscribers on Snapchat and he has a content creation deal with Snapchat. 


Ryan Smith is only 22 years old and has been making money from Snapchat since he was 16!  

Many Snapchat influencers in America make over 250 thousand dollars per year.  

Influencers can make a lot of money promoting brands, but they are not all talent and they can't fake it. 

When influencers don't have the talent to make their content appeal to their audience, they can buy followers to look legit. Buying followers can backfire with the threat of getting shadowbanned. 

Snapchat has a snap report feature that allows viewers to report influencers with fake followers for spam. 

Snapchat removed over 20 million accounts for spam activities since 2022. 

Consequently, influencers with fake followers are not going to get brand deals with American brands that want to promote their products in India.  
 

## ‚òù Top American brands are looking for Indian influencers

Why would American brands look to Indian Snapchat influencers? 

Because the youth in America are looking for brands to relate to at deeper levels, just like the youth in India.
