A group of Indian influencers recently embarked on a trip to Germany to see the country’s mesmerizing sights, meet its vibrant people, and experience its rich culture.

They visited historical landmarks, mingled with locals, attended galas, and even watched a football match as they toured the country, fully sponsored by brands that they had partnered with across one of the most used social media platforms in the country, Facebook.

The Beckham Football Academy Germany (BFAG), which is building its first football academy in Germany, sponsored the group to promote the academy’s launch and its training programs through a series of video and photo posts that would appear on the influencers’ Facebook pages.

The Academy is designed to teach football to young athletes, which is why it decided to sponsor Indian influencers. Football is growing in popularity among Indian youths, and a brand presence on social media pages frequented by them is a great way to create interest in the academy.

A spokesperson for BFAG, Shubham Chitalia, spoke on a post on the organization’s Facebook page about the rise of football in India and how it plans to provide training for successful players to truly become athletes capable of competing at the world level.

The BFAG’s sponsorship of the Indian influencers is just one of the many occasions that Indian influencers are getting brand deals in Germany through Facebook.

## 🎯 Who are Indian Facebook Influencers in Germany?

The influencers who recently enjoyed their sponsored trip to Germany are a group of social media stars from India, who share content about their experiences, fashion, dance, and lifestyle with their followers. They are popular for showcasing the beauty of India and its cultures on social media, and their followers number in the millions.

Despite the cultural distances between India and Germany, many Indian influencers have become increasingly popular among the German populace, and that popularity has attracted brands in Germany, who are looking to tap into their Indian audience for their products.

In Germany, Indian influencers continue to create and share content and even promote a variety of products through Facebook. Unlike in other countries where Instagram is the preferred social media platform among influencers, Facebook is a far more popular platform for influencers in Germany.

A September 2023 article by statista.com reported that 46 % of the German population over 14 years of age uses Facebook, which is more than any other social media site in the country. This means that Facebook is a great platform for brands in Germany looking to reach its populace. 

Facebook’s widespread use among German citizens also means that German brands are increasingly relying on Facebook influencers to reach their target audiences. With influencer marketing accounting for 17% of total marketing budgets in Germany, it is undeniable that the use of influencers to market products is becoming increasingly mainstream in Germany.

Indian influencers are vying for a share of this lucrative influencer marketing industry in Germany by partnering with brands looking to reach the Indian populace there. The number of Indian influencers partnered with brands in Germany is set to increase even more by 2025 as more Germans become aware of the popularity of Indian influencers in Germany and the viability of influencer marketing.

## 💰 How do Indian Facebook Influencers Find Brand Deals in Germany?

Indian Facebook influencers in Germany usually find brand deals through influencer marketing agencies that specialize in partnerships between brands and social media influencers.

These agencies typically boast a vast network of influencers, spanning numerous countries and numerous social media platforms, making them ideal for brands looking to partner with influencers for marketing campaigns.

One such agency is Bollywoo, an influencer marketing service based in Delhi. Bollywoo has a dedicated international department that specializes in cross-border influencer marketing services focusing on Europe. The agency is capable of connecting Indian influencers currently in Germany with brands there that are looking for influencers.

A spokesperson for Bollywoo, Nisha Kaur, stated that they help forge collaborations between Indian influencers and brands in Germany looking to tap into the Indian audience. According to her, they offer end-to-end services, helping create content and managing influencer campaigns.

With its dedicated department focusing on Europe, Bollywoo is able to generate brand deal opportunities for numerous Indian influencers who are also currently located in Germany.

Another influencer marketing agency that helps Indian influencers find brand deals in Germany is the Germany-based, IneedSocial.com.

Similar to Bollywoo, IneedSocial.com has successfully connected brands in Germany to influencers from India, especially those who are already based there. In the past, they have partnered Indian influencers with numerous reputable brands in Germany including the likes of:

- Delhi Diamonds
- Styles by Richa
- Maddox Productions
- Gokul's South Indian Restaurant
- Wadhwa Group of Companies
-  Innocean Worldwide India

IneedSocial.com is reputed for having a high success rate in helping influencers acquire brand deals. The agency guarantees to match influencers with brands that meet the influencers' financial expectations and personal values. Additionally, IneedSocial.com takes a percentage of the influencer’s commission, allowing influencers to get started for free.

What makes services like that of Bollywoo and IneedSocial.com invaluable to Indian influencers in Germany is that they handle all communication between influencers and brands, including negotiations. The influencer does not have to worry about discussing payments or how to charge brands, as these agencies take care of that.

They also handle all the logistics, including booking flights and accommodations for influencers traveling to a different city or country for experiences they would share online. They also handle the entire campaign after the influencer has received their brand deal, managing their deliverables.

These services provided by influencer marketing agencies allow Indian influencers in Germany to fully commit to their brand deals without distractions.

## 📞 Contacting Brands Directly

Aside from influencer marketing agencies, Indian influencers in Germany may also reach out directly to brands for brand deals. 

While this approach does not guarantee results, it does allow influencers to reach out to brands that they truly resonate with, like those that match their personal style or values. If successful, this can lead to a more authentic partnership between the influencers and the brands.

A good example of an Indian influencer who has successfully partnered with numerous brands in Germany is the Indian chef, Gaurav Anand. Anand is the owner of the popular Gaurav Anand restaurant in Berlin, Germany.

He has been recognized in numerous publications for his culinary skills and his restaurant has become a favorite for locals and tourists alike. Anand has also appeared on several television shows and has delivered numerous speeches at different events.

As a well-established figure in Berlin, Anand is also increasingly sought after for his opinion on numerous brands. He regularly shares Facebook posts promoting various products that he has partnered with, including:

-  K Café
-  Alco Personal Care
-  OptiWell
-  Amorelie

While Anand may have had an established career before transitioning to become an influencer, Indian influencers needing assistance securing brand deals in Germany can still utilize the direct approach by contacting brands themselves. 

What is important is to have a properly laid out plan on how to pitch themselves to brands, as well as prepared media kits that provide brands with necessary details about the influencer’s effectiveness.

## ✅ Securing Payments for Brand Deals

One of the main concerns for Indian influencers venturing into the German influencer marketing space is whether they will be paid the agreed amounts for their collaborations with brands. 

The concern stems from the fact that many Indian influencers who have ventured into other parts of the European influencer marketing space have expressed difficulties receiving payments for their brand deals.

Some influencers have claimed that brands would insist on using payment methods that they were unfamiliar with, such as cryptocurrencies or decentralized finance technologies to pay them. Other influencers have claimed that brands would send them personal checks rather than wire the agreed amount directly to the influencers’ bank accounts.

To ensure that they do not fall victim to unscrupulous brands, Indian influencers pursuing brand deals in Germany can utilize reputable payment service providers that have built solid reputations for secure payments to assist them.

Many influencers consult or hire reputable payment service providers to handle payments they are owed for their brand deals. One such service provider is the India-based payment company, Payoneer, which has a popular payment service that helps facilitate transactions between brands and influencers.

One of its most notable features is its ability to make cross-border payments more efficient for brands, who may otherwise encounter hurdles doing so directly. The company allows brands to pay influencers in their local currency and through their preferred payment method, ensuring that influencers receive their due payments without any complications.

This eliminates any potential issues that may arise from unfamiliar payment methods or inconsistent payment procedures that could hinder Indian influencers from receiving their payments from brands for their collaborations.

## ❗ Contracts for Brand Deals

Another crucial aspect of securing brand deals for Indian influencers is ensuring that they have contracts in place for such deals. Contracts are vital as they provide legal protections for influencers and brands alike.

For influencers, contracts outline what is expected of them and how they will be compensated for their work. Contracts serve as a reference during disputes about deliverables, timelines, and payment, thereby protecting the influencer’s rights to their compensation.

For brands, contracts help ensure that influencers uphold their end of the bargain and deliver on their promises, securing their investment in influencer marketing campaigns.

Many Indian influencers have previously encountered problems with brands during collaborations that breached their agreements and did not pay them as promised. For instance, some influencers have stated that they would not receive any follow-ups from brands that they have sent their media kits to, despite initial correspondence indicating that they would receive brand deals.

These issues can often be easily resolved if influencers have contracts in place for their brand deals. Influencers can refer to contracts and remind brands of their obligations under the contract, helping to ensure both parties fulfill their obligations.

## 🔋 Providing Adequate Deliverables

In Germany, it is common for both brands and influencers to impose penalties on each other for breaching their agreements, including failing to deliver adequate deliverables or not meeting deadlines.

Breaches on the part of brands can affect their reputations among influencers, as well as lead to potential claims for damages. On the other hand, breaches on the part of influencers can lead to negative reviews about them from brands. Such negative reviews typically circulate among brands and can affect the influencer's ability to secure future brand deals.

Adequate deliverables are vital for successful brand deals, and influencers need to ensure that they deliver what they promise to brands. If influencers promise to post five pictures and three videos on their Facebook pages, then they should deliver on those promises, or they risk facing penalties.

## 🇩🇪 Summary

Germany is one of the most lucrative influencer marketing markets in Europe, and its popularity is expected to continue rising among brands looking to use social media influencers to market their products. With that rise in popularity comes increased competition, and Indian influencers in Germany will have to work hard to secure brand deals.

Fortunately, various influencer marketing agencies are now specializing in helping Indian influencers break into the German influencer marketing scene. Agencies like Bollywoo and IneedSocial.com are key players for Indian influencers trying to get brand deals in Germany. They provide valuable services like logistics, negotiations, and campaign management, allowing influencers to focus on content creation.

Coins, payments, and contracts are also vital aspects of brand deals that Indian influencers in Germany will have to familiarize themselves with, as they are just as critical to ensuring successful brand deals.

As more Indian influencers venture into Germany for lucrative brand deals on Facebook, they will need to leverage all available avenues to secure those brand deals, including influencer marketing agencies, direct outreach to brands, and complying with the details of their agreements. 

If they do so, they are likely to see increased revenues from their successful collaborations with brands on Facebook.
