As an Indian brand or marketer looking to collaborate with a Korean band influencer to widen your market reach, you might be confused about the remuneration structure of these influencers. While some Korean band influencers charge a flat rate for promotional deals, others don‚Äôt have a fixed cost structure and instead think about the promotional deal holistically.

## üí° Korean Band Influencers‚Äô Promotion Rates in India

Korean band influencers usually charge brands an average of ‚Çπ83,000 to ‚Çπ2,00,000 per promotional Instagram post, ‚Çπ1,00,000 to ‚Çπ3,00,000 per YouTube video promotion, and ‚Çπ1,50,000 to ‚Çπ5,00,000 per promotional Instagram Story. It is important to note that these are average rates; there are influencers and bands that charge more, and there are also influencers that charge lower rates than the values stated above.

In the case of K-Pop band BTS, for instance, the band‚Äôs promotional post in 2022 for a Korean cosmetics brand was priced at a whopping INR 11.6 crores. The band is known for charging brands high promotional fees due to their huge following on social media. The higher the influencer‚Äôs following, the more brands are likely to pay them for promotional deals. This is a trend that is common across the influencer marketing spectrum. 

When it comes to BTS members, some of them charge lucrative promotional fees. For instance, Jungkook prices his collaboration deals around INR 1.75 crores. Similarly, Jimin charges about INR 1.55 crores for every post he makes for brands. 

## üè¶ Payment Method of Korean Band Influencers in India

Like Indian influencers, Korean band influencers can be paid in a variety of methods. However, the most popular payment method among Korean band influencers is through bank transfers. Most of them prefer bank transfers because it‚Äôs much easier for them to avoid revealing any personally identifiable information to payment apps or virtual wallets.

Some Korean band influencers do accept payment through payment apps as well, but they‚Äôre not as willing to do that compared to bank transfers. 

As an Indian brand looking to collaborate with a Korean band influencer, you might wonder how to send money abroad. One of the best ways to send money abroad from India is through the Money2World platform. It allows you to send money across the globe at the best exchange rates.

## üí¨ Differences in Remuneration Structure of Korean Band Influencers

While talking about payment, it is also equally important to note that the remuneration structure of Korean band influencers is a bit different from Indian influencers. Unlike Indian influencers who mostly charge brands a flat fee for promotional deals, Korean influencers take a more holistic view of the promotional deal instead of looking at it only through the lens of remuneration.

For instance, if they‚Äôre being sent a product in exchange for a promotional post, they ask for something in return for their time and efforts spent on the promotional post, whether that be free products or a payment. In the case of a cash payment for a promotional post, they are known to charge a much lower fee than what they would normally charge. 

In a nutshell, Korean band influencers expect adequate compensation for promotional placements. If they are not being paid, they expect to at least receive a product from the brand to cover their efforts.


## üì¢ Tips to Reach Out to Korean Band Influencers

Engaging with a Korean band influencer in order to collaborate with them can be quite a challenge for brands, especially for those in India. This is primarily because of the language barrier that prevents them from communicating authentically and effectively with the influencer and their team. 

However, the good news for Indian brands is that they can use the services of an influencer marketing agency that specializes in influencer marketing in Korea. One such influencer marketing agency that Indian brands can work with is BaoLiba.

## üìà Collaborate with Korean Band Influencers in India in 2025

With the growing popularity of K-pop around the world and especially in India, collaborating with Korean band influencers can do wonders for brands looking to tap into the Indian market. 

In the upcoming years, K-pop is only expected to grow in popularity due to the talent and skills displayed by K-pop stars, making them a force to be reckoned with in the global culture. This means that more and more Korean K-pop band influencers are expected to emerge.

Based on this trend, it is safe to say that Indian brands will have a plethora of choices when it comes to Korean band influencers in 2025. 

Even with the plethora of choices, brands will still need to be very strategic in selecting the right Korean band influencer that is aligned with their brand and campaign goals. Selecting the wrong influencer will not just hinder the promotional campaign but also damage the brand‚Äôs reputation.
