While Indian brands are increasingly using Video Accounts influencers to reach Chinese consumers, Chinese KOLs‚Äô marketing costs remain somewhat of a mystery.

As an Indian brand looking to promote its products or services in China via influencers, it is important to understand the payment structure, including promotional pricing, commission fees, and the payment methods typically used by KOLs.

This article will elaborate on everything you need to know about costs and payment structures for collaborating with Video Accounts influencers.


## üé• What are Video Accounts?

Video Accounts, owned by Tencent, are a popular video-sharing and live-streaming platform in China.

Launched in 2020, the platform is rapidly gaining traction among Chinese users, attracting millions of creators and influencers.

Integrated with WeChat and other Tencent products, Video Accounts boast impressive user engagement thanks to their short-form format and entertaining content.

Chinese influencers on Video Accounts primarily create vlogs, comedy skits, tutorials, and other engaging videos.

The platform‚Äôs seamless integration into Tencent‚Äôs social ecosystem allows influencers to share their content across WeChat, QQ, and other widely-used Chinese social media.


## üí∑ How Chinese Video Account Influencers Charge for Promotions in India

KOLs on Video Accounts charge flat fees for individual promotional posts or videos, typically ranging from $40 to $1250 (converted to USD) depending on their follower count and engagement levels.

To further analyze the fees charged by influencers on Video Accounts, I‚Äôve categorized influencer costs into three distinct tiers based on their follower counts:

### üíé Level 1: Micro KOLs 
- **Follower Count**: 10,000 - 100,000 
- **Promotional Cost**: $40 - $300 
- **Typical Payment Methods**: Cryptocurrency, Alipay, WeChat Pay

Micro KOLs on Video Accounts generally charge between $40 and $300 for promotional videos based on their follower counts and engagement levels. 

### üéñÔ∏è Level 2: Mid-tier KOLs 
- **Follower Count**: 100,000 - 500,000 
- **Promotional Cost**: $300 - $800 
- **Typical Payment Methods**: Cryptocurrency, Alipay, WeChat Pay

Mid-tier KOLs charge $300 to $800 for promotional videos, which may include product placement, reviews, and tutorials.

### üëë Level 3: Macro KOLs 
- **Follower Count**: 1,000,000+ 
- **Promotional Cost**: $800+ 
- **Typical Payment Methods**: Cryptocurrency, Alipay, WeChat Pay

KOLs with over a million followers may charge upwards of $800 for promotional videos, sometimes going as high as $1250.

While levels are based on follower count, engagement levels also play a crucial role in determining promotional pricing. 

### üìä Promotional Pricing Table 


| Category | Follower Count | Cost (USD) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Micro KOLs | 10,000 - 100,000 | 40 - 300 |
| Mid-tier KOLs | 100,000 - 500,000 | 300 - 800 |
| Macro KOLs | 1,000,000+ | 800+ |


## üí∞ Commission-Based Payment Methods for Collaborating with Video Account Influencers in India

In addition to charging flat fees for promotional posts or videos, KOLs on Video Accounts often earn commissions based on performance metrics such as sales or leads generated.

**Performance Metrics and Related Earnings for Video Accounts KOLs:**

- **Sales Commissions**: You can offer a commission for every sale made through links or codes shared by influencers. 
- **Lead Commissions**: Provide a commission for every lead generated via influencers, such as sign-ups or inquiries. 
- **Traffic Commissions**: Offer a commission for traffic driven to your website or landing page through influencers, measured by clicks or visits. 

### üö® Additional Payment Information

KOLs on Tencent‚Äôs Video Accounts typically prefer cryptocurrency, Alipay, or WeChat Pay for payments. 

Due to China‚Äôs strict regulations on international payment processes, PayPal and bank wire transfers are often unreliable for sending payments to KOLs.

### üí´ Why are Video Accounts Influencer Fees in USD?

Promotional prices for KOLs on Video Accounts are often quoted in USD for three reasons:

1. **International Marketability**: Influencers aspire to make their profiles appear more attractive to foreign brands looking for international outreach. Pricing in USD gives a global impression and signals a foreign market focus.
   
2. **Consistency**: USD is a widely recognized global standard for financial transactions, ensuring consistency across diverse markets. When influencers quote prices in USD, it prevents confusion and aligns expectations with brands worldwide.

3. **Value Perception**: Citing prices in USD can create a perception of added value in promoting products or services. Influencers may believe that showcasing their promotional costs in USD enhances their worth to potential partners, especially those seeking overseas engagement.

### üíµ Payment Structures Summary Table  


| Payment Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Flat Fees | KOLs charge a fixed amount for promotional content (usually in USD). |
| Commissions | KOLs earn bonuses for performance metrics like sales or web traffic. |
| Preferred Methods | Cryptocurrency, Alipay, and WeChat Pay are commonly used for payments. |
