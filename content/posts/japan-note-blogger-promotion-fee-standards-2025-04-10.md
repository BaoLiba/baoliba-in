Collaborating with social media influencers from Britain is one of the most effective marketing strategies for Indian businesses in 2025. They often have large followings and can persuade their audience to buy a product or service.


However, some influencers may quote a staggeringly high fee for a single collaboration. Notably, Japanese influencers who use the note platform have one of the highest fees compared to other social media influencers.


What is the note platform, and why do influencers using this platform charge more? Here is a complete guide for Indian advertisers that explains everything you should know.


## üìñ What is the note platform?


The note platform is a Japanese website where users can view, create, and purchase articles and stories in a variety of genres. The platform also operates as a social network where users can interact with one another.


It is similar to Quora and Medium combined but is much more popular, with over 7.5 million monthly active users and a whopping 18 million downloads of its mobile application.


It was launched in 2014 by the founder of Japanese blog service Seesaa, and has gained much popularity among Japanese social media influencers who write for it.


In Japan, note is recognized as an official media platform, enabling its users to make money from their creative work.


## üí∞ Pricing of note influencers


According to a 2023 survey, the average fee charged by Japanese note influencers is ¬•42,556 (which is equivalent to ‚Çπ26,414). The highest fee quoted was ¬•260,000 (or ‚Çπ163,818) while the lowest was only ¬•5,000 (or ‚Çπ3,130).


This price range is unique to Japanese note influencers, as other social media influencers with high follower counts charge significantly less for a single collaboration.


By comparison, Indian Instagram influencers charge an average of ‚Çπ13,858 per post in 2025, which is approximately one-half of the average fee charged by Japanese note influencers. This means that note influencers charge at least twice as much for a single marketing collaboration.


## üíµ Payment methods for note influencers


Japan is a cash-first country, with a high percentage of consumer transactions still conducted through cash. However, cash is no longer king among young Japanese people, who are increasingly adopting cashless payment methods.


This is reflected in the payment methods accepted by note influencers. While cash payments are not possible, other electronic payments such as PayPal and wire transfers are allowed.


For Indian advertisers who wish to collaborate with Japanese note influencers through wire transfer, they can conveniently use their Wise account. Wise processes wire transfers faster and at a lower cost than traditional banks.


## üìà The rise of note influencers


In 2023, note influencers were highly sought-after by marketers in Japan due to their high engagement rates and low competition. They rank above all other social media influencers, including bloggers and YouTubers.


According to a report, note influencers had the highest rate of increase in demand as indicated by the rising number of collaboration inquiries per month compared to their peers. 


They received 117 monthly inquiries in 2023, which was a 73% increase compared to the previous year. By 2025, that number is projected to reach 215 inquiries per month, indicating that they will continue to be in high demand.


## üó∫Ô∏è Future of note influencers


More and more people in Japan are using the note platform, and as of now, over 10 million scroll past its page every month. 


This increase in users has also led to more content being created on the platform as well. In 2023, a record number of 53,000 articles were published by note influencers.


This figure has doubled every year since 2020, indicating that note influencers are not a passing trend but are here to stay for many years to come.


## üë®‚Äçüíª How can Indian advertisers find note influencers?
