Over the last few years, the Indian social media app, ShareChat has become the first choice for influencers and brands alike to connect with their target audience and to build authentic one-on-one connections. Its unique hyperlocal approach has allowed it to seamlessly connect millions of people across diverse communities and cultures. 

While ShareChat is primarily an Indian app, the influencers on this platform are not confining their influencer marketing efforts within Indian borders. We have seen Indian ShareChat influencers reaching out to Australian brands to help them penetrate the Indian market. 

So, how are they doing it? 

In this guide, we will explore how Indian influencers on ShareChat are finding brand deals in Australia. 

## 🎯 ShareChat’s Hyperlocal Potential 

Although ShareChat is not as big as Instagram or YouTube, it has become the most widely used Indian app for content creation by influencers. According to the latest data, it boasts over 400 million users, mostly from rural continents. 

One of the biggest reasons why this app has outdone others in this space is its exceptional hyperlocal approach. 

Unlike other platforms, ShareChat has over 15 Indian languages to better connect content creators with their audience. ShareChat influencers can customize their feeds based on their geographical locations, interests or languages. 

This means that ShareChat influencers are more likely to engage with their audience in a way that resonates with them personally. 

As a result, brands are opting for ShareChat influencers in their marketing efforts, especially those that specifically target Indian communities. 

## 🤔 Why Australian Brands Want to Work with Indian ShareChat Influencers

Despite its Indian roots, ShareChat possesses immense potential for Australian brands looking to penetrate the Indian market. 

According to a statement from the Australian Trade and Investment Minister, “India is one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world and we are rapidly expanding our footprint in this important market. That means there is a range of opportunities for Australian businesses in India.” 

However, penetrating such a vast and diverse market can seem daunting. This is where Indian ShareChat influencers come into the picture. 

### 🤝 Local Connection 
Australian brands can build connections with their target audience by collaborating with Indian influencers on ShareChat who understand their audience’s preferences, interests, and needs. 

The audience of ShareChat influencers often consists of potential customers who trust their recommendations. 

### 🌐 Reach Diverse Communities 
Australia is a multicultural nation with a significant population of people with Indian roots. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, “an estimated 381,000 people born in India were living in Australia in 2021.” 

Collaborating with Indian ShareChat influencers can help Australian brands reach these communities effectively.

### 🚀 Leverage Hyperlocal Potential 
The hyperlocal nature of ShareChat allows brands to target specific geographical areas within India. For example, if an Australian brand is looking to target people in the state of Punjab, they can connect only with ShareChat influencers who cater to audiences located in Punjab. 

By leveraging the hyperlocal features of ShareChat, Australian brands can reach their Indian audience more efficiently.

### 💡 Affordability 
Compared to other influencer marketing platforms, ShareChat influencers are much cheaper. Their tools are also mostly free, allowing brands to create campaigns at no cost, while reporting and analytics tools are provided to help brands assess the ROI of their campaigns. 

As such, Australian brands have much to gain from partnering with Indian ShareChat influencers.

### 🔑 Wrap Up 
Indian ShareChat influencers are also looking beyond Indian borders to find brand deals, especially in Australia. 

This is partly due to Australia’s growing desire to connect with India as an emerging market. 

While the process might initially seem daunting, brands can connect with Indonesian ShareChat influencers in several ways.  

Among the best ways is to use an influencer marketing platform like Universe Media.
