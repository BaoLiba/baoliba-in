In India, Telegram influencers are exploring opportunities for brand deals in Japan. 

Telegram influencers from India are now extending their brand deal pursuits in Japan. The influencers leverage the private messaging app's unique features to reach their audience and connect with potential brands for collaborations.

According to a report by research company TechSci, India's Telegram brand influencer market size is expected to reach USD 2 billion by 2025, registering a CAGR of 18.61% between 2020 and 2025. 

Although the majority of Telegram influencers are focused on the Indian market, some Telegram influencers are now opting for Japan. 

üìä **Telegram influencers in India**

Over the past couple of years, Telegram has surged in popularity in India, particularly as an influencer marketing platform.

The messaging app has emerged as a major platform for influencer marketing in India, accounting for about 30% of India's influencer marketing market in 2023, according to an August 2023 report by media agency group Wavemaker.

The influencer marketing firm reported that India's Telegram influencer marketing industry has grown steadily each year. 

In 2023, the number of brand deals via Telegram is estimated to hit about 260,000. The number of brand deals via Telegram is projected to reach about 468,000 by 2025.


üìà **Why are Indian Telegram influencers looking for brand deals in Japan?**

In 2022, more than 2.6 million people traveled to Japan. 

According to the Japan National Tourism Organization, Indians are among the top 10 travelers to Japan, ranking sixth behind tourists from the United States, China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. 

The continuous increase in the number of Indian tourists in Japan has attracted greater attention from Indian Telegram influencers. They see this growing market as an opportunity to pursue brand deals in Japan.

Various Telegram influencers in India, especially those in the travel niche, are pursuing brand deals in Japan. Influencers in this niche will work with brands in Japan to promote their products or services to Indian tourists traveling to Japan.

üì≤ **How do Telegram influencers in India find brand deals in Japan?**

Indian Telegram influencers looking to partner with brands in Japan typically use the same approach they would use for brands in India. 

The Telegram influencers will first create a media kit outlining their audience, engagement numbers, and past sponsorships. They will then visit the official websites of brands in Japan they want to work with. 

After creating a media kit, the influencers will visit the official websites of potential brands they want to partner with. For example, suppose an influencer wants to work with a hotel during their trip to Japan. In that case, the influencer will search for hotel brands in Japan that fit their brand. 

For example, if they want to partner with a hotel in Tokyo, the influencer will search for hotels in Tokyo. The influencers will then visit the official website of each of the hotels to get the contact information of a relevant person they can reach out to. The relevant person could be a member of the marketing team or the public relations team. 

Next, the Telegram influencers will send out emails to multiple brand representatives, introducing themselves and their Telegram channel. They will tell the brand representatives why they would be a good fit for the brand and how they want to collaborate. 

Typically, the influencers will invite them to a conversation for more discussion about collaborating and how the brand can benefit from the partnership. The influencers may also send them a copy of their media kit.  

**Working with influencer agencies in Japan**

Some Indian Telegram influencers looking for brand deals in Japan may choose to work with influencer agencies in Japan. The influencers may reach out to agencies in Japan to offer their services and request brand collaborations in Japan.¬†

The Japanese influencer agency can connect the Indian Telegram influencers with brands in Japan that are looking for influencers to promote their products. 

Working with influencer agencies in Japan can benefit Indian influencers pursuing brand deals in Japan. The agencies have a good understanding of the market landscape, including who the key players are and what works within the market. 

In addition, the agencies can handle negotiations between the influencers and the brands, as well as the contracts between the two parties.

 üåè **Japanese products Indian Telegram influencers can promote**

Here are some popular products in Japan that are potential opportunities for Indian Telegram influencers. 

**Hats**

Japan is known for its stylish hats, and its caps are no exception. For example, the stylish caps from Japanese eyewear and cap brand Mita Cap are well known among cap enthusiasts in Japan and beyond.¬†

The hats and caps by Japanese brands cannot be found in any other country, including India. Therefore, the stylish caps made in Japan are great products for Indian Telegram influencers to promote. They can market the caps as a must-have for any fashionable look. 


**Japanese skin care products**

Japanese beauty products are popular around the world. Many products in the Japanese skin care product space are marketed towards women. However, more brands that manufacture male skin care products are emerging in Japan. 

Indian Telegram influencers can partner with companies that make Japanese skin care products for men to promote their products to Indian men who want to upgrade their skincare routine. 

**Japanese cuisine**

Japanese cuisine is known for its intricate flavors, fresh ingredients, and gorgeous presentations. Dishes like sushi and ramen have contributed to Japanese food‚Äôs growing popularity around the world.

Indian Telegram influencers focusing on the food niche can partner with Japanese restaurants to promote their offerings to Indian tourists. They can create mouth-watering Telegram posts and videos about the unique dishes being served at the Japanese restaurants. 

üí∏ **How much are brand deals in Japan worth for Indian Telegram influencers?**

Brand deals in Japan can be quite lucrative for Indian Telegram influencers. On average, brands pay Telegram influencers in the country between USD 52 and USD 305 for each sponsored post on Telegram. 

According to influencer platforms, the price for one sponsored Telegram post is typically between USD 100 and USD 200. 

However, Japanese brands generally pay 50% more than brands in other countries that do influencer marketing. This means that many Indian Telegram influencers can earn close to USD 500 per sponsored Telegram post. 

ü§ù **Payment methods for Indian Telegram influencers getting brand deals in Japan**

There are several payment methods available to Indian Telegram influencers receiving brand deals in Japan. 

These influencers can receive payments in Japanese yen directly to their bank account in India. They can also receive payments from brands in Japan via PayPal or Wise.¬†

With PayPal, influencers need to create a PayPal account and link it to their bank account in India. They can then receive payments in Japanese yen via their PayPal account. 

On the other hand, Wise allows Indian Telegram influencers to have a multi-currency account. This account can hold and convert different currencies, including yen. Unlike PayPal, which is a payment processor, Wise is a bank transfer service that allows influencers to receive money directly in their bank account in India. 

Indian Telegram influencers looking to receive payments in yen from brands in Japan via Wise must first set up a Wise account. However, they must provide personal identification documents and proof of address. Once their account is verified, they will receive a Japanese bank account number. 

The influencers will then provide this bank account number to brand representatives in Japan so the brands can send payments in yen directly to their Wise account. 

After that, the influencers can convert the yen to Indian rupees and send the money to their bank account in India. 

‚öñÔ∏è **Legal considerations for Indian Telegram influencers getting brand deals in Japan**

As Telegram influencers in India begin to venture into the Japanese market, they need to understand certain legal considerations before pursuing brand deals.¬†

For one, it is important to understand that contracts with brands in Japan may not be handled the same way as those in India. Brand representatives in Japan may require Telegram influencers to sign contracts that are primarily in Japanese. 

Telegram influencers targeting brands in Japan can hire a translator to help them navigate contracts in Japanese. 

The telegram influencers must also understand that they may need to undergo a screening process by brands in Japan before they can gain a contract. 

In addition, brands in Japan may expect influencers to demonstrate a level of professionalism and commitment, which may include meeting deadlines and maintaining communication throughout the collaboration.

üö® **Risks for Indian Telegram influencers pursuing brand deals in Japan**

While pursuing brand deals in Japan can be a lucrative opportunity for Telegram influencers in India, it is important they remain aware of the potential risks. 

Indian Telegram influencers may need to ensure that any contracts they sign with brands in Japan are legally binding. In their communication with brands in Japan, they need to clarify whether contracts can be enforced under Indian law.¬†

If a dispute arises regarding the contract, the influencer will want to ensure that any legal recourse is available and enforceable in India. 

In addition, Telegram influencers targeting brands in Japan must make sure they fully understand the terms and conditions of any contract before signing it. They need to ensure that their rights and interests are effectively protected. 

They should also be aware that contracts with brands in Japan may impose obligations on influencers regarding intellectual property rights. 

For instance, brands in Japan may require influencers to assign or license certain intellectual property rights regarding the content they create while promoting their products. 

If Telegram influencers do not fully understand these terms, they could inadvertently lose rights to the content they create. 

Therefore, Indian Telegram influencers considering brand deals in Japan need to approach the collaboration carefully and with a good understanding of the potential risks involved.
