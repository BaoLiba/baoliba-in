The digital marketing landscape in Bangladesh has evolved significantly in recent years, with brands increasingly recognizing the value of influencer marketing. As they seek to connect with their target audience and establish a strong online presence, companies are turning to influencers on various platforms, especially LinkedIn.

However, what makes LinkedIn especially unique from its social media counterparts is the fact that the majority of influencers in Bangladesh are actually Indian. 

This trend raises the question as to why Bangladeshis prefer to partner with Indian influencers, especially when they have a plethora of Bangladeshis influencers at their disposal, and how Indian influencers are able to find brand deals in this foreign market?

## ‚ùó Why Are Indian Influencers Preferred Over Bangladeshis?

It is no secret that Bangladeshis are quite enamored with India; a fact that has been demonstrated time and time again across a variety of contexts. This admiration extends well into the realm of social media, with many Bangladeshis opting to work with Indian influencers instead of their local counterparts.

### The Colonial Hangover

The fact that Bangladeshis and Indians share a largely similar upbringing is rooted in their colonial history as subjects of the British Empire. 

As former subjects of the British Empire, both nations share much of the same cultural, linguistic, and social background, making it easy for Bangladeshis to relate to Indians and vice versa. 

This cultural similarity means that Indian brands and Indians in general often find a natural footing when entering Bangladesh, and vice versa. 

This sometimes manifests itself in the fact that there are many Indians and Indian companies operating in Bangladesh today.

### More Professionalism In Their Approach

More often than not, Indian influencers have demonstrated to be more professional than Bangladeshi influencers, not only when it comes to producing content, but also when it comes to brand partnerships.

In many instances, Indian influencers have been seen to demand less from brands while providing higher quality content. This has made Indian influencers considerably more appealing to Bangladeshi brands, especially for those limited by budget constraints.

One influencer who has gained popularity in Bangladesh is Indian digital creator and marketing expert, Saurabh Singh. Having amassed over 739,000 followers on LinkedIn, Singh frequently provides marketing tips and strategies through his posts, which have garnered the attention of many Bangladeshi brands. 

‚ÄúI have been receiving queries from Bangladeshis to create content for them, for which I will be charging a fee obviously, unlike the free posts I do for my followers,‚Äù Singh said in a post.

‚ÄúBeing an Indian, I strongly believe that I can help Bangladeshi brands grow their business in 2025 and beyond through my posts,‚Äù he added.

### The Proximity Advantage

It is also worth noting that Bangladesh and India share a border that runs for 4,096 kilometers along the eastern frontier of India, effectively making Bangladesh a neighbor of India. 

As a result, the countries share many ties: cultural, linguistic, historical and economic. This proximity makes it easier for Indians to operate in Bangladesh, especially regarding brand activations. 

This is also an additional reason as to why Indian influencers have a higher success rate in Bangladesh than Bangladeshi influencers have in India. 

### The Language Barrier

Although Bangladeshis and Indians have a largely similar upbringing, it is worth noting that the Bengali language is quite distinct from Hindi, which is predominantly used in India.  

As a result, while Indian influencers can communicate with Bangladeshi audiences with relative ease, the same cannot be said for Bangladeshi influencers trying to reach Indian audiences. 

In fact, many Bangladeshi influencers have found that their content fails to resonate with Indian audiences because of language barriers, which make it harder for them to break into the Indian influencer market.

## üí° How Do They Find Brand Deals?

Due to the fact that Indian influencers have cornered the Bangladeshi influencer market on LinkedIn, many of these influencers have also devised a strategy to seek brand deals in Bangladesh.

### Posting About Their Skills

As mentioned before, Saurabh Singh is one of many Indian influencers who have begun advertising their services on LinkedIn, specifically targeting the Bangladeshi market.

Using LinkedIn's platform for professionals, influencers like Singh frequently post about their skills, what they can bring to the table, and how they can help Bangladeshi brands penetrate the market. 

### Leveraging The Power Of Networking

It is also worth noting that LinkedIn is known as a platform for networking and building professional relationships, something that many influencers have sought to leverage in their favor.

Through LinkedIn, Indian influencers have been able to engage with Bangladeshi brands directly, making it easier for them to find partnerships without having to rely on intermediaries or talent agencies.

### Group Posts

Many Indian influencers have also been seen posting their offers for brand partnerships in groups that have been created to cater to Bangladeshi audiences.

While such groups have a majority of Bangladeshi members, these Indian influencers have found their posts to be especially effective, as many members of such groups are often searching for influencers to partner with. 

This is especially true of the Digital Marketing group, which has 27,000 members and has been the host of many Indian influencers advertising their services to Bangladeshi brands. 

Many of these Indian influencers have also claimed to have received numerous requests for partnerships stemming from these posts.

### Content That Is Relatable

When it comes to actually creating content, Indian influencers have tailored their content in a way that speaks to their Bangladeshi audience, making them even more appealing.

For example, Indian marketer and entrepreneur, Ankit Gupta, often combines Indian pop culture references with Bengali language in his posts, making his content relatable and understandable for the masses. 

His efforts have certainly paid off, as he has garnered over 170,000 followers on LinkedIn, with many of these followers hailing from Bangladesh.

‚ÄúMany Bangladeshi corporates and individuals have reached out to me to create posts for them,‚Äù Gupta said in a post.

‚ÄúI am also open to Bangladeshis who want to work in any of the Indian cities,‚Äù he added.

## üìä Are They Getting Paid In Rupees?

Despite the fact that Indian influencers have found great success in securing brand deals in Bangladesh, many have pointed out the fact that they have not yet been paid in Indian Rupees. 

Instead, many have reported being paid in Taka, the currency of Bangladesh.

This has naturally raised concerns regarding whether or not Indian influencers should continue to pursue brand deals in Bangladesh, as Taka is considerably weaker than Indian Rupees. 

For example, as of this writing, 1 Indian Rupee is equal to 1.23 Bangladeshi Taka. 

While this may not seem like much, the fact that many Indian influencers are being charged with a relatively higher fee in Taka than they would have charged in Rupees has made this form of payment appealing.

### The Payment Gateway Problem

The reason as to why many Indian influencers are opting to get paid in Taka rather than Rupees is primarily due to the fact that the vast majority of Indian payment gateways are blocked in Bangladesh. 

As a result, there are very few ways for Bangladeshi brands to pay Indian influencers in Indian Rupees, forcing them to settle for Taka. 

Even when Bangladeshi brands do wish to pay Indian influencers in Rupees, they often encounter more obstacles. 

For example, Bangladeshi brands looking to send money to Indian accounts can only do so through a bank known as Sonali Bank, which has only recently started operating in India. 

In fact, prior to 2021, Sonali Bank was the only Bangladeshi bank that was allowed to operate in India, which limited transaction capacity. 

## üì¢ What Lies Ahead?

As Bangladeshi brands continue to embrace influencer marketing, they will continue to seek out influencers who best fit their needs. 

For now, Indian influencers have positioned themselves as the leading candidates for brand deals in Bangladesh, and it does not appear that this will change anytime soon. 

In fact, it is quite likely that we will start to see even more Indian influencers entering the Bangladeshi marketing scene in the coming years, especially as the popularity of influencer marketing continues to rise. 

As for Bangladeshi brands, they can expect to see an influx of Indian influencers advertising their services on LinkedIn as well. 

In fact, it is likely that they will see many more posts like the following: 

‚ÄúHello, I am an Indian Influencer on LinkedIn, looking for Bangladeshi brands to work with. I can work with you in 2025 and beyond. Please send me your requirements.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease hire me, I am an Indian influencer and I want to work with a Bangladeshi brand in 2025 and beyond.‚Äù
