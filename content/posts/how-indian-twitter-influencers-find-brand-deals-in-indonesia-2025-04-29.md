In the past decade, Indonesia has experienced a boom fueled by its vibrant social media scene and a growing influencer marketing industry. 

With its population of over 270 million, Indonesia has become an attractive market for multinational brands eager to tap into its burgeoning potential.

As India‚Äôs Twitter influencers look for opportunities to expand their markets and boost their portfolios, Indonesia has become a prime target.

That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre forging partnerships with Indonesian influencers to help them secure brand deals in the country.


## üõ¨ Indonesia is primed for Indian Twitter Influencers

The majority of Indonesia's social media users flock to Instagram and TikTok.

However, as a country with a vibrant political scene and a culture of public debate, Twitter remains a major platform for Indonesians.

With an increasing number of Indonesian influencers stepping into the spotlight, the platform is an ideal ground for Indian influencers to find brand deals in Indonesia.

The Indonesian influencer industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25% between 2022 and 2025, reaching a market value of $5 billion by 2025.

This makes it a prime target for Indian influencers, particularly those specializing in political commentary.

Indian political Twitter influencers are renowned for their engagement, insight, and sharp commentary.

Indonesia is a politically active country where Twitter is the preferred platform for public figures, politicians, and the general public to voice their opinions.

By teaming up with Indonesian influencers, Indian Twitter influencers can help them secure lucrative brand deals while leveraging Indonesia's social media landscape.

As the Indonesian influencer market continues to grow, Indian Twitter influencers are increasingly seeking to establish brand collaborations in the region.

In Indonesia, influencers receive a 9% commission on every purchase made through their links, making the partnership even more lucrative.

### ü§ù The benefits of team-ups

High-profile Indonesian influencers typically have a good number of followers and a high level of engagement. 

However, they usually lack the expertise to maximize their impact in the crowded Indonesian market.

This is where Indian Twitter influencers come in.

By teaming up with Indonesian influencers, Indian Twitter influencers can inject their expertise into the partnership, boosting the overall effectiveness of their campaigns.

In addition, they can leverage their followers‚Äô trust to enhance their credibility.

A trusted endorsement can go a long way in the influencer industry, especially in a market like Indonesia where influencers are often viewed as mere salespeople.

By teaming up with Indian Twitter influencers, Indonesian influencers can increase their credibility and trust among their followers, leading to higher engagement rates and better conversion rates.

This is particularly important in a market like Indonesia where consumers are increasingly wary of influencer marketing tactics.

### üí¨ How partnerships are formed

Indonesian influencers often reach out to Indian Twitter influencers for collaborations. 

However, unlike their Indonesian counterparts, who usually turn to other influencers directly, Indian Twitter influencers often rely on established influencer marketing platforms.

These platforms connect Instagram and TikTok influencers with brands looking to promote their products or services.

On social media, the industry is rife with allegations of scams and influencer flops.

In response, critics have encouraged potential influencers to work with established agencies. 

Indian influencers looking for collaborations in Indonesia have adopted the same approach.

Platforms like Bangalore-based BaoLiba connect Indian influencers with their Indonesian counterparts while providing essential tools for the collaborations.

Once established, these partnerships enable Indian Twitter influencers to use their expertise to help their Indonesian counterparts secure lucrative brand deals. 

### üè¶ Payments

Payment gateways may pose a challenge for some influencers hoping to secure brand deals in Indonesia.

However, platforms like BaoLiba that connect Indian influencers with Indonesian counterparts have made it easy.

According to a report by the Economic Cooperative Organization (ECO), Indonesia has over 80 payment gateways, making it one of the most diverse payment environments in Asia.

The report states that local payment gateways account for 70‚Äì80% of all transactions in Indonesia.

While platforms like BaoLiba use popular payment gateways like Paypal, Indian influencers can also receive payments through popular local payment gateways like OVO and DANA.

### üáÆüá© Indonesian influencers

According to a report published by influencer marketing platform Sociabuzz, 93% of Indonesian influencers consider themselves to be micro-influencers.

Sociabuzz defines micro-influencers as those with between 1,000 and 100,000 followers on their primary social media platforms.

Some opt for local partnerships instead.

Bangalore-based influencer marketing agency Veloce India recently collaborated with Indonesian YouTuber Aghnia Shaza.

Shaza has over 2.63 million subscribers and over 1 billion views on her YouTube channel. 

The collaboration marked the first time that a South Asian influencer marketing agency has worked with an Indonesian YouTuber.

According to the press release, Veloce India worked with Shaza to promote the animated Hindi film ‚ÄúGandhi 2: Back to the Future.‚Äù

The collaboration is a testament to the growing demand for brand collaborations in Indonesia, particularly from Indian influencers.

With the Indonesian influencer industry projected to continue on its upward trajectory, Indian Twitter influencers can expect to see even more opportunities for brand collaborations in the country.

### üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Be careful of scams

While there are many legitimate influencer marketing platforms in India and abroad, the industry is rife with scams and frauds.

These scams can take many forms, from fake influencer profiles to non-existent brands looking to promote non-existent products.

Unfortunately, the influencer marketing industry has become a breeding ground for scammers.

According to the IIMA report, brand fraud is the biggest challenge facing Indian influencers. 

The report states that 49% of Indian influencers have encountered brand fraud at least once in their careers.

Moreover, 24% of Indian influencers said they had encountered brand fraud more than four times.

### üö´ Identifying scams

So how can Indian Twitter influencers avoid scams when looking for brand collaborations in Indonesia?

Here are a few tips:

1. **Research the influencer marketing platform:** Check the platform‚Äôs website, social media profiles, and reviews to determine if they are legitimate.

2. **Look for red flags:** Be wary of platforms that require upfront payments or promise unrealistic results. Genuine platforms usually charge a fee to brands rather than influencers.

3. **Verify brand representatives:** If a brand approaches you through an influencer marketing platform, verify their identity and legitimacy before proceeding.

4. **Trust your instincts:** If something feels off or too good to be true, it probably is. Trust your instincts and proceed with caution.
