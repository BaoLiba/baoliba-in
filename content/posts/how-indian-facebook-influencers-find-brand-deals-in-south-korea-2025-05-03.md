In the traditional sense of brand deals, Indian influencers in South Korea, particularly on Facebook, may not have the same opportunities to promote brands like in India due to the lack of South Korean brands in the Indian market.

The traditional model of celebrity endorsement doesn't quite fit with the social media influencer model since influencers are generally seen to be more relatable to their audiences compared to traditional celebrities.

However, Indian influencers in South Korea check both the boxes of relatability and celebrity status among the Indian audience in South Korea. The talent management agencies that represent them have made it possible for them to monetize their influence and create opportunities for brand deals with South Korean brands targeting the Indian diaspora.

As the demand for influencers in South Korea increases as well as the need for global influencers, these agencies are making it possible for Indian influencers to keep up with the trends.

In this article, we will explore how Indian influencers in South Korea are getting brand deals with South Korean brands through their talent management agencies, what their brand deals entail, and how they are able to create results that meet the expectations of their brands.

## üìû How Indian Influencers in South Korea Get Brand Deals

The most straightforward way Indian influencers in South Korea get brand deals with South Korean brands is through their talent management agencies. Talent management agencies actively scout and recruit influencers to represent them, especially influencers that possess a unique angle that can give them an edge in the competitive influencer marketing industry.

In this case, the unique angle is the influencer‚Äôs Indian identity and their relatability to the Indian diaspora in South Korea.

Some talent management agencies that represent Indian influencers in South Korea include **Dawnsons**, **Horizon**, and **Soulful Dreams**. They are just a few of the many talent management agencies working with Indian influencers in South Korea to secure brand deals.

### üí° How Talent Management Agencies Work

Talent management agencies typically work with influencers on a commission basis. They charge a percentage of the influencer's earnings from brand deals secured through them. The longer the influencer works with the agency, the more efficient and optimized their workflow becomes.

This commission model incentivizes the talent management agency to find as many brand deals for the influencer as possible.

They do this by connecting the influencer with South Korean brands directly or by partnering with a South Korean talent management agency that specializes in influencer marketing.

The partnership with the South Korean talent management agency allows the Indian influencer to work with a local representative who speaks the local language and understands the intricacies of the local culture.

For example, **Dawnsons** has a partnership with South Korea's largest talent management agency, **YBM**, to help Indian influencers work with South Korean brands.

Dawnsons manages **Manisha Shree**, a makeup artist and influencer who is one of the very few Indians in South Korea to get brand deals with South Korean brands.

Manisha has partnered with **HERA**, a luxury beauty brand in South Korea, to promote their products. She created a video of her using HERA's makeup products to achieve the famous **Korean glass skin** look, showing her audience how to use the makeup products correctly.

Manisha typically gets paid around 100,000 INR for an hour of her time spent filming for a brand deal. This is an amount that many local South Korean influencers would earn for a short TikTok video, further demonstrating her celebrity status among Indian audiences.

## üì± How Indian Influencers in South Korea Secure Brand Deals on Facebook

To understand how Indian influencers in South Korea secure brand deals on Facebook, we need to understand the features of Facebook that are available to influencers and how they can utilize those features to show their value to potential brands.

### üìå Facebook Page

Facebook allows users to create pages, which are profiles that represent a business, celebrity, organization, or brand. Pages have features that can enhance the user experience and allow for seamless communication between the page owner and their audience.

Indian influencers in South Korea create Facebook pages to showcase their work and connect with brands looking to work with influencers. Some features that can help them achieve this include:

1. **Call to Action Button**: This button motivates the audience to take action after viewing the influencer's page. It can be customized for different actions, such as calling the influencer directly, sending them a message on Facebook Messenger, or visiting their website or booking link. For example, if an influencer has a booking link, the audience can set an appointment directly from the page. 

2. **About Section**: The About section allows the influencer to share a brief summary of who they are and what they do. This section gives brands a sense of what the influencer is about, and the influencer can include links to their other social media profiles and a link to their email. This gives brands easy access to communicate with the influencer.

3. **Services Section**: The services section allows the influencer to list the services they provide, which are basically the deliverables that a brand can expect when they work with the influencer. The influencer can include additional information for each service, such as a description, pricing, time taken to deliver, and a booking link.

4. **Video Section**: Video is the most engaging type of content on social media. The video section of the influencer's page allows them to showcase their best work to brands and allow brands to see how they can benefit from working with the influencer.

5. **Content Section**: The content section of the influencer's page showcases all their posts in one central location. Brands can see how often the influencer posts and the type of content they create.

### üì± Facebook Group

Facebook groups are communities of people who share a common interest. Groups can be public or private, and they foster deeper connections than pages can. Indian influencers in South Korea can find groups of South Korean brands looking to connect with influencers.

In these groups, Indian influencers can introduce themselves and express their interest in working with brands. They can also showcase their work and provide links to their Facebook pages or other profiles.

Some Facebook groups where Indian influencers in South Korea can find South Korean brands looking for influencers include:

- **Korean Influencer Marketing Agency** 
- **Korean Fashion Bloggers and Influencers**
- **Social Media and Influencers in Korea** 
- **K-Beauty and K-Fashion Influencers in Korea** 

These groups all have members who are looking for influencers to work with and who are open to welcoming new members.

### üí° Facebook Ads

Facebook ads allow users to advertise on Facebook and Instagram. Advertisers can opt to set up their ads through the Facebook app or directly through the Facebook Ads Manager.

Indian influencers in South Korea can use Facebook ads to advertise their services to brands that may not be familiar with them. They can create a brand deal application funnel where brands can learn about the influencer, view their portfolio, and apply for a brand deal. 

Brands that are interested can fill out the application, which is sent to the influencer in their Facebook Messenger, or the influencer can configure it to go to their email. The ability to collect leads is one advantage that Facebook ads have over traditional influencer marketing outreach.

## üóìÔ∏è What Brand Deals Do Indian Influencers in South Korea Get?

South Korean brands looking to work with Indian influencers in South Korea can expect similar deliverables as those they would get when working with any other influencer. However, the expectations are higher due to the influencer's established celebrity status among their Indian audience.

The most common deliverables Indian influencers in South Korea can offer South Korean brands include:

1. **Social media posts**: This is the most common deliverable. The influencer creates a post on one or multiple social media platforms featuring the brand's product or service. This can be in the form of a photo, video, or slideshow. 

2. **Social media stories**: Stories are temporary posts that disappear after 24 hours. They are more casual and engaging than regular posts. The influencer can create multiple stories to promote the brand's product or service, which can be viewed repeatedly until the 24-hour countdown ends.

3. **Live streams**: Influencers can go live on social media to engage with their audience in real-time. They can showcase the brand's product or service during the live stream and answer questions from the audience. 

4. **Blog posts**: If the influencer has a blog or website, they can create a blog post featuring the brand's product or service. Blogs allow for more comprehensive coverage of the brand's offering compared to social media posts.

5. **Email marketing**: Email marketing is a powerful tool that allows the influencer to promote the brand's product or service directly to their audience's inbox. They can create an engaging email that captures the essence of the offering and includes a link to purchase or book.

6. **Promotional videos**: Promotional videos are more polished and professionally produced compared to regular social media videos. The influencer can create a promotional video highlighting the brand's product or service, which they can share on their social media platforms or website.

7. **Brand ambassador roles**: An influencer can take on the role of a brand ambassador for a specified period. This means they will actively promote the brand's product or service on an ongoing basis, typically longer than a one-off collaboration. Brand ambassadors usually have a closer relationship with the brand compared to other influencers.

## üèÅ Conclusion

The connection between Indian influencers in South Korea and talent management agencies is a critical factor in how they secure brand deals with South Korean brands. Indian influencers in South Korea are paving the way for Indian influencers worldwide to be able to monetize their influence and earn brand deals.
