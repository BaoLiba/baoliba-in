## ü§ù How to Get Involved with Dutch Brands

Despite the impressive number of Dutch marketers who are on the lookout for Indian influencers to work with, actually getting involved in the Netherlands influencer scene will require some effort from your side.

Here are some ways Indian influencers can get brand deals in Netherlands:

### 1. **Make sure you‚Äôre open to working with global brands.**

Although Dutch brands are keen to work with Indian influencers, it does not mean that you can just expect unsolicited brand deals. 

Keep in mind that while Indian influencers can be beneficial to Dutch brands, Dutch brands will likely have the same expectations as Indian brands when it comes to working with influencers. 

This means that you should be willing to produce high-quality content that resonates with the target audience, be willing to go the extra mile to meet the demands of the brand, and deliver on time. 

#### 2. **Sign Up for an Influencer Marketing Platform.**

If you‚Äôre an Indian influencer with a good presence on Twitter and have a reputable following, then you have a high chance of finding Dutch brands looking to work with you on an influencer marketing platform. 

Many influencer marketing platforms focus specifically on connecting influencers with brands. 

Some of the reputable platforms to consider signing up to include:

**BaoLiba** - This global influencer marketing platform connects brands and agencies with social media influencers and bloggers in over 100 countries around the world. 

Apart from Netherlands, BaoLiba has a presence in several European and Asian countries and offers innovative solutions, including campaign management tools and in-depth analytics.

Once signed up, you will have the ability to browse through campaigns listed by brands looking for influencers to work with and apply to those that you find suitable for your profile.

**FlexLifestyle** - Flexlifestyle is an influencer marketing agency that specializes in lifestyle and health-related campaigns. 

The agency helps brands connect with influencers who can create authentic content that resonates with their target audience. 

FlexLifestyle has worked with various brands in different countries including Netherlands. 

**The Influencer Marketing Factory** - The Influencer Marketing Factory is an influencer marketing agency that specializes in connecting brands with influencers in various niches. 

The agency has worked with several brands in different countries, including Netherlands. Their focus is not only on connecting brands with influencers but also on creating customized campaigns that meet the unique needs of each brand.

These influencer marketing platforms generally have specific criteria that influencers must meet to be eligible for campaigns, so be sure to check for those before signing up.

#### 3. **Aim for the Best Quality Content.**

In order to stand out from the crowd, you must aim for the best quality content that you can produce. 

Dutch brands that reach out to Indian influencers to work with them expect only the best quality content to come from their campaigns, so make sure you have what it takes to deliver high quality. 

Consider investing in higher quality cameras to capture stunning images and videos, and if needed, enlist the help of a professional photographer or videographer to help you stand out. 

While the influencer marketing landscape is rapidly evolving, one thing is clear: brands looking to connect with consumers must take a digital-first approach. 

With consumers spending more time on their devices than ever before, brands must leverage the power of social media and influencer partnerships to reach their target audience. 

This applies to those in India looking for Netherlands brands to work with as well.

#### 4. **Engage with Local Accounts.**

Last but not least, if you‚Äôre an Indian influencer who is actively looking for brand deals in Netherlands, you must engage with local accounts and connect with them. 

While many overseas brands might be searching for Indian influencers who have a huge following and engagement rates, nothing sells better than a warm recommendation from a local influencer. 

So be sure to engage with local influencers and accounts, connect with them, and build a community with them. 

This way, when opportunities arise for Indian influencers to collaborate with Dutch brands, you‚Äôll be one of the first ones in line.

## üîé What Brands can Expect from Indian Twitter Influencers

For Dutch brands, collaborating with Indian Twitter influencers can yield several advantages. 

Apart from increasing the reach of their advertising campaign, Indian influencers can also save brands money and advertising budget that they can invest in more areas.

Here are some things Dutch brands can expect from Indian Twitter influencers:

### 1. **Higher Engagement Rates.**

According to research by the influencer marketing analytics company, Influencer Marketing Hub, Indian influencers have higher engagement rates than the average Western influencer. 

In fact, the research found that Indian influencers, on average, have a higher engagement rate across all platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok.

Just because Indian influencers have a larger reach than local influencers in Netherlands does not mean that they cannot maintain or even boost engagement rates.

### 2. **Authenticity.**

Indian Twitter influencers have more authentic-looking accounts that can be appealing to Dutch brands. 

Most of their followers are genuine and they will not suffer high levels of fake accounts. 

This level of authenticity is attractive to brands who want to create a more genuine connection with their target audience.

### 3. **Creativity.**

Creativity is a must when it comes to influencer marketing, and that applies to Twitter too. 

If you are an Indian Twitter influencer with a reputation for being creative, you will be an ideal candidate for Dutch brands to partner with. 

Other than just creative tweets, be sure to showcase your creativity in your bio description, profile picture, and cover photo, and use pinned tweets wisely to achieve ultimate exposure for your account.

### 4. **Diversity.**

Diversity is something Dutch brands are looking for, and they are expecting Indian Twitter influencers to deliver just that. 

By working with Indian influencers, Dutch brands can create a more diverse campaign that stands out from the competition. 

It is important to keep in mind that not all Indian influencers are the same and they will have different experiences and perspectives to share, so make sure that you embrace your unique identity and showcase it proudly.
