The next time you scroll through ShareChat and find an influencer trying to sell an Arabic perfume, don‚Äôt be too surprised.

They might be earning a fancy commission from a Saudi brand looking to make its mark in India.

Top influencers on the popular Indian vernacular social media app say Arabic brands are keen to tap into the Indian market that boasts of a sizeable Muslim population.

According to them, Arabic brands are looking to penetrate the Indian market via popular local influencers on platforms like ShareChat, where they are more confident about reaching a relevant audience.


One of the top entertainers on ShareChat, Munna Bhaiya, says he regularly collaborates with several Arabic brands, including Arabian perfumes, dates, and honey makers.

‚ÄúArab brands prefer to work with local influencers. They find them more trustworthy than ads in the mainstream media. I have worked with Arabian brands selling perfumes, dates, and honey, among other things. They send their products to me in India, and I create sponsored posts to promote them to my followers,‚Äù Munna Bhaiya said.

He explained that Arabic brands are interested in creating awareness of their products in India, which has a significant Muslim population.


In fact, he believes Arabic brands see local influencers as a bridge to connect with Indian consumers more effectively than traditional ads.

‚ÄúThe amount of perfume being sold in the Indian market is huge. You walk into any perfume shop in India, and 90% of their inventory is Arabic perfumes. Arabic brands are keen to tap into the Indian market. They want Indian consumers to choose their products over their competitors, especially in the perfume segment,‚Äù said Munna Bhaiya.

Munna Bhaiya, who is a famous actor on ShareChat and other platforms, has millions of followers and earns a lucrative income through brand promotions.


He added that Arabic dates and honey are also very popular in India, especially among Muslims. The last two years have witnessed a surge in Indian imports of these products.

Munna Bhaiya, who is the CEO of Mad2Fame Network, a rapidly growing influencer marketing agency, said he has also tied up with one of the largest sellers of Arabic perfumes for influencer marketing services.

He admits that negotiations with these brands can be tough.

‚ÄúWe charge them prices similar to what we would charge any Indian brand. The only difference is that payment from Arabic brands is made in USD or INR, and they often prefer to send their products to influencers instead of direct payment,‚Äù Munna Bhaiya explained.



üí° The share of the Saudi perfume market taken by Arabic brands is staggering.

In the Middle East, Arabic perfumes command impressive market shares, with the regional perfume market expected to reach over $5 billion by 2025.

And according to a study by Mordor Intelligence, the market was valued at approximately $3.03 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.84% during the forecast period of 2020-2025, indicating a strong growth trajectory for the industry. 

The study found that the Arabian perfume segment holds a significant share of the market, with an estimated 70% of the total sales volume in the UAE coming from these types of fragrances. In addition, over 90% of the perfume sold in the region is produced locally.

This is a staggering number, especially considering that the UAE only accounts for around 4 percent of the global population.

Some estimates suggest that people in Dubai buy 23 times more perfume than the average person elsewhere.

The Arabian perfume market is characterized by high consumer demand, innovative packaging, and an increase in imports of premium perfumes.

Moreover, the shift in consumer preferences from alcohol-based perfumes to oil-based perfumes, especially among the traditional population of the GCC countries, will drive the growth of the market.


üî• With so much prestige captured by Arabic perfumes, it‚Äôs little wonder they are so well received in India.

‚ÄúIndians are known for being fragrance enthusiasts, so it‚Äôs no surprise they love Arabic perfumes,‚Äù said Shubham Gaur, CEO of Influencer Marketing Agency, BuzzFlick.

Shubham explained that Arabic perfumes have a rich history and are often made using high-quality natural ingredients, giving them a depth of scent that many people find appealing.

In addition, Arabic perfumes often have long-lasting fragrances and utilize unique blending techniques, setting them apart from Western-style perfumes.

With the growing interest in Arabic culture, as evidenced by the popularity of Arabic music and films, it‚Äôs no wonder that Arabic perfumes are gaining traction in India.‚Äù

He added that influencers have the added advantage of building a relationship and establishing credibility with their followers. 


To facilitate the penetration of Arabic brands into the Indian market, BuzzFlick recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with two major organizations in Saudi Arabia.

The MOU was signed with the General Authority for Small and Medium Enterprises of Saudi Arabia and the Saudi Export Development Authority, both SEGA affiliated.

Under the MOU, BuzzFlick will assist in helping Arabic brands enter the Indian market through influencer marketing. 

‚ÄúBuzzFlick will help Saudi brands with influencer marketing, and we will also help Indian brands that want to enter the Saudi market. Our teams will work together to support brands from both countries in mutual co-branding efforts,‚Äù said Shubham.


üîë As the CEO of BuzzFlick, Shubham explained that the signing of the MOU will facilitate the entry of Arabic brands into the Indian market.

The Saudi Export Development Authority focuses on developing and supporting small- and medium-sized enterprises by providing various services tailored to the needs of entrepreneurs, investors, and other stakeholders in the sector.

The authority aims to increase the competitiveness of SMEs and their contributions to the Saudi economy. 

They do this by providing a range of services such as financing, training, consulting, and networking opportunities. They also work to improve the business environment for SMEs by advocating for policies that support their development and growth.

The MOU with the Saudi Export Development Authority reflects the shared commitment of both parties to promote economic cooperation and support the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises in both countries.

In a recent statement, Saudi Deputy Minister for Small and Medium Enterprises, Osama Al-Munif, stated that India occupies a unique position in the global economy.

He acknowledged that the Indian economy is one of the fastest growing, and that India is a focal point for many businesses and investors looking for expansion opportunities.

He added that Saudi Arabia has great ambitions to shift its economy away from oil dependency and tap into the potential of the small- and medium-sized enterprise sector.


üí¨ The Saudi Arabian government is taking a far-sighted approach to help its small businesses reach foreign markets.

India has emerged as a leading business and trade partner for Saudi Arabia. The two countries are already working together in many economic sectors.

Commercial ties between both countries have been strengthening. Bilateral trade between the two nations is projected to exceed $100 billion with the contribution of Indian exports crossing $40 billion to $45 billion by 2025.

Shubham expressed confidence that Saudi brands can make significant inroads into the Indian market with the help of Indian influencers.

‚ÄúIndia has the largest online audience in the world, and the country is witnessing a boom in influencer marketing, especially on social media platforms like ShareChat. Brands across sectors, including travel, fashion, and F&B are leveraging influencer marketing to engage with consumers and build brand awareness,‚Äù he said.

Shubham added that the collective monthly user base of BuzzFlick and ShareChat influencers exceeds 200 million. 

He believes that this enormous outreach can significantly benefit Saudi brands looking to raise brand awareness and sales in India.


üéâ Agencies like BuzzFlick will act as a gateway for Saudi brands looking to penetrate the Indian market.

ShareChat influencers also have the potential to help Saudi brands amplify their reach and connect with relevant Indian audiences.

Shubham is hopeful that Saudi brands will be as enthusiastic as their Indian counterparts when it comes to influencer marketing.

‚ÄúIndian brands are already experimenting with various influencer marketing strategies, such as gifting, sponsored posts, endorsements, and events. Many brands are working with influencers across different tiers, from micro, macro, to mega influencers, and even celebrities,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúIf Saudi brands make full use of influencer marketing, they can effectively boost brand awareness and stimulate sales in India, particularly in the tourist hotspot of Jeddah.‚Äù
