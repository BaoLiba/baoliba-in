The rise of Insta influencers and TikTok stars has ushered in an entirely new world of marketing tactics involving authority figures with dedicated audiences.

Moj, an Indian short video application, is a growing contender in the advertising landscape and is helping to set the stage for budding influencers. The app acts as an equivalent to TikTok since it operates in nearly identical ways.

But with Moj quickly becoming a platform where influencers can find brand deals through networking, is Saudi Arabia a hot spot for Indian influencers? 

What remains fascinating, though, is how Indian Moj influencers are targeting foreign markets, particularly in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East, queuing up for brand deals like they would a Bollywood film debut. 

In this article, we will uncover the undertaking of Indian influencers as they travel to Saudi Arabia in search of lucrative brand deals - one moj at a time.

## üìä Market Data

A report published by Grand View Research in January 2023 stated that the Middle Eastern influencer marketing sector had a valuation of $1.4 billion in 2022. This figure is projected to swell to a market cap of $3.17 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.7%.

The survey stated, ‚ÄúThe growth of influencer marketing in the Middle East is mainly driven by the increasing penetration of social media and the rising number of influencer marketing campaigns by brands.‚Äù

Given the exponential expansion forecasted, it comes as no surprise why Indian influencers are looking to capitalize on the growing industry in Saudi Arabia.

Indian Moj influencers are tapping into the Saudi influencer marketing ecosystem due to strong demand in the region.


## üëΩ Indian Influencers Meant to Be In Saudi Arabia?

According to a report conducted by YouGov, in 2022, Saudi Arabia was the fastest-growing digital influencer market in the Middle East region, possessing over 1,700 influencers, with 70% of the population engaging with influencers on social media. 

Indian Moj influencers are tapping into the Saudi influencer marketing ecosystem due to strong demand in the region as local brands look to engage with Indian audiences centered around tourism, education, and religious pilgrimage.

Overseas Pakistani and Indian influencers have dominated the local influencer market for years. They know how to tap into user-generated content (UGC) through the lens of the Indian audience that makes up a considerable percentage of travelers in the region.

According to Saudi Arabia‚Äôs tourism agency, nearly a million tourists from India traveled to the Kingdom in 2022, indicating the significance of the Indian market for local businesses.

‚ÄúSaudi Arabia is one of the high-priority markets for tourism in India, and that encompasses both leisure and business travel,‚Äù said Alhad Karungaonkar, vice president of the India division for the Saudi Tourism Authority.

‚ÄúSaudi Arabia received more than a million tourists from India last year because it is a top destination for religious travel. That figure is expected to grow by 40% in 2023,‚Äù he added.


## üí≥ How Do Indian Influencers Pitch for Saudi Brand Deals?

As the second-largest market for Moj behind India, the application is flooded with aspiring influencers that already have a firm grasp on how to engage an audience.

To become a Moj influencer, an account must have at least 1,000 followers and a minimum of 10,000 video views in the last 30 days. After that, an application can be submitted for the Moj Creator program, which provides tools and analytics for the creator‚Äôs account, monetization opportunities, and exclusive events.

Moj influencer marketing is gaining traction as brands harness the power of Moj influencers to market their products through authentic content. 

Moj influencers typically reach out to brands through direct messages (DM) or via their contact section in their bio.

Additionally, influencer marketing platforms like Baoliba, a global influencer marketing platform, are utilized to streamline the process of finding brand deals.

Baoliba pre-vets both influencers and the brands seeking them out for partnerships, ensuring that both parties are credible. The platform makes it simple for brands to promote goods and services through influencer partnerships without getting bogged down by the complexities of finding one that fits.

According to Baoliba, a travel package company in Saudi Arabia paid an Indian influencer INR 1 lakh ($1,200) to create a few posts about their trip to the Kingdom. 

Additionally, the influencer was provided complimentary travel packages for his family. 


## ‚úàÔ∏è Indian Influencers Craving the Saudi Experience

The allure for Indian influencers traveling to the Kingdom is a mix of business and pleasure. They typically indulge in luxury travel experiences and enjoy the beauty of the country while at the same time securing brand deals that can earn them a sizable chunk of money.

Luxury lifestyle influencer, Akanksha Rajput, recently published a post indicating that she was one of 18 Indian influencers chartered on a plane to Saudi Arabia. Her caption stated, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt believe we are on a plane to Saudi Arabia with @tourismsaudi to have fun in Saudi.‚Äù

Another influencer, Abhishek Paliwal, said that he was among a select few Indian influencers invited to tour The Line, a futuristic pillar of Saudi Arabian architecture, as part of a tourism initiative. 

‚ÄúI was the first Indian influencer to visit the site of Neom and The Line. I was paid INR 2.5 lakh ($3,000) for my work, which included seven days of travel package fees, including accommodation,‚Äù said Paliwal.

Indian influencers have become accustomed to the lavish hospitality of Saudi Arabian officials, as influencers from Pakistan had paved the way before.

Pakistani influencers were paid to create content showcasing their experiences in Saudi Arabia, including lavish banquets hosted by ambassadors of tourism. Local Saudi Arabian officials benefited by attracting more travelers to their country from the large Indian and Pakistani markets.


## üåê Digital Domination

Saudi Arabian influencer marketing has become so lucrative that influencer marketing hubs have emerged with the sole purpose of supporting influencers in their pitch for brand deals.

Peridot Talent, an influencer marketing agency in Dubai that has represented over 2,300 influencers, including many from Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, recently announced plans to start an influencer marketing and talent agency in Pakistan.

The chief executive officer (CEO) of Peridot, Mr. Ali, said they plan to kick-start their operations within six months and become the largest talent agency for influencers and celebrities in Pakistan by 2025.

Peridot Talent already represents over 300 influencers from Pakistan. CEO Ali stated that commercial and brand partnership offers for influencers in Pakistan tripled in 2022 compared to 2021. In 2023, the offers are expected to triple once again.

This digital domination has paved the way for Indian and Pakistani influencers to flood the market looking to secure Saudi brand deals. 


## ‚ùó Risks Indian Influencers Face in Saudi Arabia

While the potential for brand deals in Saudi Arabia has many Indian Moj influencers chomping at the bit to score an invitation, it is not all glitz and glam.

Indian influencer, Zaid Darbar, recalls being detained by Saudi officials after leaving Jeddah airport due to his long hair and a dress he was wearing.

Dressed in attire from Indian fashion designer, Manish Malhotra, Darbar was approached by Saudi Arabian police and accused of cross-dressing and acting like a woman.

‚ÄúMany people are traveling to Saudi to fulfill their dreams‚Ä¶ there is no such thing as the fear of being a cross-dresser because this is a stereotype,‚Äù said Darbar.

‚ÄúIt was strange for me. Things have improved in Saudi Arabia, but some people still need to understand that fashion is not gender-specific,‚Äù he added.

Another Indian influencer, Raavi Sidhu, was jailed for a night after a mishap with her visa turned into a full-blown scandal. Sidhu and her husband were arrested after unknowingly entering the Kingdom using a visa meant for a different person with the same name.

‚ÄúWe had reached Saudi Arabia after a long journey, we were tired and just wanted to get over the visa issue and continue with our work. But the officials were adamant and they even laughed at us. We were not allowed to take any calls,‚Äù said Sidhu.

The couple remained in custody until they managed to get the correct visa, which delayed their plans for a week.

Another Indian influencer detained in Saudi Arabia is Faizan Ansari, a viral Instagram star facing charges for filming a video at the Prophet Muhammad Mosque in Medina.

Ansari and his associate were reportedly arrested for shooting a video that ‚Äúsimulates‚Äù a woman‚Äôs pregnancy, which was allegedly filmed at the mosque without permission.

Ansari reportedly faces 6 months to 2 years in prison and a fine of 100,000 Saudi Riyals (INR 20 lakh) if convicted in Saudi Arabia.

Despite the risks facing Indian Moj influencers trying to tap into the Saudi market, the lucrative brand deals are too tempting to resist. 

With 2025 just around the corner, we can expect to see a growing number of Indian Moj influencers traveling to Saudi Arabia for their chance to cash in on the boom.
