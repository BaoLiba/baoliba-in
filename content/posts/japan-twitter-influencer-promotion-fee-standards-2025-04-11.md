Despite its status as a global powerhouse, Japan remains unique. It is said that Japan is a world of its own, and there are many reasons for it.

One of the things that make it so is how the country has integrated social media into the very fabric of its society. But, unlike the rest of the world that has moved on to social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok, Japan has stubbornly clung to the likes of Facebook and Twitter.

While Twitter’s popularity has dropped in most countries, it still thrives in Japan. Statista reported that by 2021, Japan was Twitter’s second-largest market.

Data from Statista also published that as of May 2023, Japan accounted for 16 percent of Twitter users globally. Most Japanese Twitter users are also active daily. The number of active daily users reached 45 million accounts in 2021 and has remained the same since.

Advertising on Twitter is gaining momentum, especially among Japanese consumers. According to a recent survey, more than 50 percent of respondents said they have purchased a product through a Tweet. 

As a result, Twitter influencer marketing in Japan has also become a huge phenomenon. But, despite its growth, the industry is still struggling under the weight of many unanswered questions. 

One of those questions is how much Japanese Twitter influencers charge for collaborations.

#### The Shadowy Side of Japanese Twitter Influencer Collaborations Pricing

Pricing is one of the murkiest aspects of influencer marketing in Japan, especially on Twitter, where most influencers keep their rates shrouded in secrecy. Unlike other platforms where pricing can be found publicly on influencer marketing platforms such as BaoLiba, Twitter influencer pricing is largely unknown.

As a result, many advertisers looking to work with Twitter influencers in Japan are left confused about how to best budget their campaigns.

While many Twitter influencers refuse to mention their rates publicly, there are several pricing resources available to help guide advertisers.

A recent report from the Japan Twitter Influencer Association indicated that Twitter influencers in Japan charge an average of 4,500 yen, or $31, for an influencer marketing Tweet. 

However, this number may not give an accurate picture of how much influencers actually charge for their services. Many of the influencers surveyed indicated that they were relatively new to the game and still trying to figure it out themselves.

In fact, according to the report, 40.5 percent of Japanese Twitter influencers charge between 1,000 and 3,000 yen for a marketing tweet—that is between $7 to $21.

#### The Price of Different Types of Collaborations 

When it comes to Twitter influencer collaborations, not all collaborations are created equal. All advertising campaigns on Twitter have different complexities and scopes. 

As a result, the pricing will look different depending on the type of collaboration you are interested in. 

##### Standard Tweets 

A standard tweet is when an influencer posts a tweet about a specific brand or product. The tweet will either mention the specific brand being advertised or include a hashtag.

A standard tweet with a link to the brand’s website will typically cost between ¥2,000 to ¥4,000 (about $14-$28). 

##### Tweet with Image

Twitter allows brands to attach images to their tweets. An influencer that posts a tweet about your brand or product and adds an image can charge anywhere between ¥3,000 to ¥5,000 ($21-$35), depending on the influencer’s authority. 

##### Tweet with Video 

Some influencers will go the extra mile for their clients and post a video on Twitter. A video tweet will usually cost between ¥5,000 to ¥8,000 ($35-$56).

##### Sponsored Trend Promotion

Brands can pay Twitter to get their tweets to trend. Getting your tweet to trend can increase visibility and engagement. However, this can be very expensive depending on how well known you want your brand to become. Sponsored trend promotion can cost anywhere between ¥3 million to ¥6 million ($21,000-$42,000).

#### Factors Affecting Pricing 

While there are average rates and ranges that can guide advertisers looking to budget for their Twitter influencer campaigns, many factors can influence how much an influencer will charge for their services.

Understanding these factors can help advertisers negotiate better deals and make sure they are getting their money’s worth from any collaborations. 

##### Influencer’s Niche 

The influencer’s niche will play a big part in how much they charge for their services. Influencers that concentrate on competitive niches like travel or technology tend to charge more than other influencers. 

Advertisers should also consider the influencer’s niche relative to their marketing campaign needs. If an advertiser needs a tech influencer but hires a mediocre travel influencer instead that charges less, their marketing efforts may not translate.

##### Audience Engagement 

Influencer authority is largely determined by their audience engagement. The more engaged an influencer’s audience is, the more likely advertisers are to get their brands in front of potential buyers.  

An influencer that enjoys high levels of engagement, reflected by the size of their audience, will charge more than one with just the numbers.  

As a result, influencer pricing can fluctuate based on how engaged their audience is. 

##### Scope of Collaboration 

The scope of the collaboration refers to how much work will be required of the influencer. A simple tweet mentioning a brand is much easier than posting a video with the influencer explaining the virtues of the product. 

Thus, the more complex a collaboration will be, the more the influencer is likely to charge.

##### Exclusivity 

If an influencer agrees to an exclusive collaboration, charging more may be a point of contention. An exclusive collaboration is when an influencer agrees not to work with other brands in the same niche within a set timeframe. 

For example, if a travel influencer agrees to an exclusive collaboration with a hotel chain, they may not work with another hotel chain for several months. 

Thus, if a brand is looking for exclusivity, they should expect to pay a higher price for it.

##### Timeline 

The more time-consuming a collaboration will be, the more the influencer will charge. The amount of time required of the influencer is a major factor in pricing. 

For example, if an influencer is required to attend an event that lasts several days, they may charge more for their services than if they just had to post a single tweet.

#### How to Pay Twitter Influencers in Japan 

After determining how much a Twitter influencer will charge for a collaboration, the next step is knowing how to pay them.

Many influencers will have payment forms on their social media accounts. However, if they don’t, there are many ways to pay them. 

Here are the most common means of payments used to settle accounts with Twitter influencers in Japan.

##### PayPal 

PayPal is an online payment platform that is widely used around the world. PayPal accounts are easy to set up and are secure. Because of this, it has become one of the most popular payment methods for influencer marketing collaborations in Japan. 

##### Stripe 

Stripe is another online payment platform that has become increasingly popular over the years. Like PayPal, it is also widely used around the world and is easy to set up and use. 

This has made it a great option for settling payments with Twitter influencers in Japan.

##### Credit Transfer 

Credit transfers are also widely used in Japan. Advertisers can also wire funds directly from their bank accounts to the influencer’s account. 

Many influencers will have their bank account details on their social media pages, making it easy for advertisers to settle accounts with them.
