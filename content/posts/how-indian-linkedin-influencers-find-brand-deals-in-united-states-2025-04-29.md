In recent years, Indian influencers have expanded their reach beyond domestic brands, targeting foreign markets for lucrative partnerships. In particular, LinkedIn influencers have increasingly attracted offers from American brands eager to penetrate the Indian market through paid promotions.

Several factors have contributed to this rising trend of Indian influencers securing brand deals from the U.S. 

As Indian entrepreneurs and professionals cultivate their LinkedIn networks, they draw attention from foreign brands seeking to tap into the burgeoning Indian market. In addition, online platforms have emerged to facilitate these cross-border connections between Indian influencers and American brands.

As the trend continues to grow, we can anticipate many Indian LinkedIn influencers establishing lucrative partnerships with American brands by 2025.


## ü™ô The Indian LinkedIn Influencer Economy is Growing

The influencer economy on LinkedIn in India has been growing rapidly, with increasing numbers of professionals monetizing their expertise and networks. According to a report, there are currently around 3,500 Indian influencers on LinkedIn, but that number is expected to reach 15,000 by 2025.

This increasing number of Indian influencers on LinkedIn is indicative of the fierce competition for brand deals. Many Indian influencers on the platform are also connecting with foreign brands, particularly those based in the United States.

In fact, a recent survey found that 82 percent of employed LinkedIn influencers in India had already received brand deal inquiries from foreign brands, with 45 percent of those inquiries coming from the United States. 


## üöÄ Indian LinkedIn Influencer Platforms Are Emerging

Given the increasing demand for paid promotions from American brands, a number of new platforms have emerged to help Indian LinkedIn influencers secure these lucrative brand deals.

One such platform is LinkedIn Influencer Club, which recently launched a program specifically targeting Indian influencers. According to the platform's CEO and founder, Prashant K. Mishra, LinkedIn Influencer Club has already collaborated with over 15,000 influencers globally, and many of them are Indian.
 
Mishra claims that 25 percent of the brand deals facilitated by the platform come from the United States. American brands are particularly interested in influencer partnerships with Indian LinkedIn professionals in the fields of technology, consulting, and management.

Another platform helping Indian LinkedIn influencers secure American brand deals is Apex Influencers. Apex Influencers has partnered with over 10,000 international brands and 30,000 influencers in total. Along with LinkedIn, Apex Influencers also operates on Twitter and Instagram.

According to Apex Influencers CEO Danish M., the majority of Indian influencers who have partnered with American brands are in the fields of technology and human resources.

## üîç American Brands Are Targeting LinkedIn Influencers

Many American brands are increasingly targeting Indian LinkedIn influencers to penetrate the Indian market. According to a report, 65 percent of U.S. brands now prefer to partner with Indian influencers on LinkedIn rather than any other platform.

This preference is largely due to the professional nature of LinkedIn and the increasing number of Indian professionals using the platform to promote their work and build networks.

Many brands recognize that partnerships with Indian LinkedIn influencers can significantly enhance their credibility among Indian consumers. This credibility is especially important for foreign brands looking to establish themselves in the Indian market.

In fact, a survey found that over 90 percent of Indian LinkedIn users are more likely to purchase products from brands that have partnered with LinkedIn influencers. 


## üí∏ Payments Are Easy for Indian Influencers

While many Indian influencers were initially apprehensive about securing brand deals from foreign companies, recent developments have made it easier than ever for Indian influencers to receive payments from American brands.

Many platforms that facilitate brand deals between influencers and brands have implemented payment systems that cater to international transactions. For example, platforms like LinkedIn Influencer Club and Apex Influencers handle all payment processes for brand deals.

As such, Indian influencers do not have to deal with the complexities of international payment systems. Instead, they can focus solely on content creation and promotion.

In addition, American brands are now more willing to utilize payment processors that Indian influencers commonly use, such as PayPal, Stripe, and Wise. In fact, many American brands exclusively use these payment processors for their brand deals with Indian influencers.

## üîó Indian Influencers Are Using Their Networks

Despite the emergence of platforms facilitating brand deals between Indian influencers and American brands, many Indian influencers still utilize their networks to secure lucrative partnerships.

Many Indian influencers on LinkedIn have a vast network of connections with American professionals. Because of this, they often receive inquiries from American brands that find them through these connections.

American brands often prefer to partner with Indian influencers who have a significant number of connections with American professionals. This preference stems from the fact that these influencers can provide direct access to a large pool of potential American customers.

In fact, many American brands even request that Indian influencers provide them with access to their LinkedIn analytics. Brands want to see not only the influencer's total number of connections, but also the number of American connections they have. 

## üë• Who Are Some Indian LinkedIn Influencers?

There are many Indian LinkedIn influencers who have successfully secured lucrative brand deals from American brands. 

One such influencer is Priyanka Aiyappa, who is a marketing consultant based in Bangalore. With over 18,000 followers on LinkedIn, Priyanka frequently posts about marketing and content creation. 

Recently, Priyanka secured a brand deal with the American computer software company, Adobe. In her sponsored post, Priyanka shared information about Adobe Express and how it benefits content creators. 

Another Indian LinkedIn influencer who has successfully secured brand deals from American brands is Ankit Mohan, who is a talent acquisition manager in Houston, Texas. Ankit has over 84,000 followers on LinkedIn and frequently posts on human resources topics.

Recently, Ankit secured a brand deal with the American software company, Zoho. In his sponsored post, Ankit discussed Zoho's HR software and how it benefits businesses. 

These two Indian LinkedIn influencers are just a few examples of how Indian LinkedIn influencers are increasingly securing brand deals from American brands. 

## ‚ùó The Future of Indian LinkedIn Influencers Sealing Brand Deals

The future of Indian LinkedIn influencers securing brand deals from American brands looks promising. With the increasing demand for influencer partnerships on LinkedIn, we can expect to see even more Indian influencers establishing lucrative partnerships with American brands by 2025.

As more Indians start leveraging their LinkedIn networks to connect with American brands, we can also anticipate the emergence of more platforms that facilitate cross-border brand deals. In addition, payment processes for international brand deals will likely become even more streamlined.

As the trend continues to grow, it is clear that Indian LinkedIn influencers will play a significant role in helping American brands penetrate the Indian market.
