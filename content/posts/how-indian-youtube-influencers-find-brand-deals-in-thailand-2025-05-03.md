## 📺 Indian YouTubers in Thailand

Like their predecessors, Indian YouTubers also started flocking to Thailand to create content, win brand deals, and explore the beautiful country.

YouTube is one of the most popular social media platforms in India, where millions of users spend hours watching videos daily. As of 2023, India accounts for 5.73 million of YouTube's total 31 million active channels, making it the largest creator landscape in the world.

With the high demand for YouTube content comes Indian YouTubers’ desire to create videos that will keep their fans entertained. One of the easiest ways to do that is by traveling to new destinations. 

And what better place to travel than Thailand, where Indian tourists accounted for the highest number of foreign visitors to the country in 2022? 

"Thailand has always held a special charm for Indians. With easy visa processes and affordable airfares, it is very convenient for Indians to travel to Thailand," said Khunying Ajarin Pattanapanchai, Deputy Governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand.

With the rising popularity of Thailand among Indian tourists, a growing number of Indian YouTubers are heading to Thailand to create travel content that captures its beauty and charm.


## 📍 Landing Brand Deals in Thailand

But just because Indian YouTubers are going to Thailand doesn’t mean they’re guaranteed brand deals. 

In an industry where social media influencers can literally be a dime a dozen, content creators must work hard to land sponsorships that will pay the bills and keep the lights on. 

Here are a few strategies Indian YouTubers can use to land brand deals in Thailand:

### 🌍 The Power of Networking

For Indian YouTubers, the key to getting brand deals in Thailand is networking. Nothing beats the power of personal connections when it comes to landing sponsorships in a foreign country. 

Many Indian YouTubers are able to secure brand deals in Thailand through their existing connections with local friends and acquaintances. 

And in today's world, where the landscape of influencer marketing is rapidly evolving, having contacts within the industry can help Indian YouTubers reach their goals. 

"Having contacts in Thailand is very important," said Saurabh, a travel vlogger from India who visits Thailand frequently. "Networking with other influencers and locals can open doors to sponsorships and partnerships that might not be available otherwise." 

### 📲 Social Media Marketing 

Social media is a powerful tool for influencers, and Indian YouTubers can leverage it to attract brand deals in Thailand. By showcasing their travel content on Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook, they can grab the attention of local brands looking to collaborate. 

Posting engaging content about Thailand on social media can help Indian YouTubers build an audience of followers who are interested in their travels. 

In fact, many brands in Thailand are now turning to social media to find influencers for their campaigns. According to a report from the influencer marketing agency, The Influencer Agency, 62% of marketers in Thailand use social media to find influencers.
