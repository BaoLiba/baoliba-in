Indian YouTube influencers are well-known for their hilarious videos, but it seems they've found a new and serious purpose‚Äîto promote products and services in Nepal.

India and Nepal share a lot in common in terms of language, culture, and geography. However, Indian YouTube influencers have discovered that they can save themselves a considerable amount of money by promoting products in Nepal using the local currency.

Let's take a look at how Indian YouTube influencers find brand deals in Nepal and whether you should consider joining them.

### üè¶ Indian YouTubers Using Nepalese Brands to Get Paid More





Youtube earnings and brand deals in Nepal are far larger than those in India, particularly for Indian YouTubers. One of the best examples is the Indian YouTuber known as Aashika Bhatia.

Aashika Bhatia is a well-known Indian actress and YouTuber who specializes in vlogs. She has over 4.5 million Youtube subscribers and can earn up to ‚Çπ12 lakh ($14,500) per video from brand deals in Nepal alone.

In India, however, Aashika can earn only about ‚Çπ2 lakh ($2,500) per video for the same brand deal. That's 83% more money just for accepting payments in Nepalese rupees instead of Indian rupees.

Aashika Bhatia isn't the only one doing this, as many Indian YouTube influencers have been cashing in on the lucrative Nepalese market.

In another instance, a YouTuber by the name of Joseph Wouters claims he was able to secure a brand deal worth ‚Çπ35 lakh ($42,000) for a single video promoting a grocery store. The same influencer could not get even ‚Çπ1 lakh ($1,200) for the same brand deal in India.

This shows just how lucrative brand deals in Nepal can be, especially for Indian YouTubers.

### üßæ How Indian YouTubers Accept Payments in Nepal



Because of the seven-fold difference between Nepalese and Indian currency, Indian YouTube influencers can easily make a lot more money by promoting products in Nepal.

However, getting paid in Nepalese rupees isn't easy for many influencers. To accept payments on behalf of Indian YouTubers, Sandeep Singh, an Indian, set up a business in Nepal to act as the intermediary.

Sandeep charges a payment processing fee for accepting payments in Nepal and transferring them to Indian bank accounts. Currently, the fee is five percent of the total amount transferred.

Indian YouTube influencers require a business to accept payments on their behalf, as Indian banks are not connected to Nepalese financial institutions. As such, they cannot receive payments directly into their accounts in India. 

For YouTubers who aren't keen on setting up a business in Nepal or working with an intermediary like Sandeep, they can opt for payment services like PayPal to receive fees for brand deals.

However, since most brand deal payments can be large sums, Indian YouTubers run the risk of having their PayPal accounts suspended for suspicious activity.

### üíπ Why Nepal Brand Deals Pay More






In contrast to India, advertisements in Nepal are not limited to how many minutes can show ads. This means there are far fewer restrictions for brands to market themselves on YouTube in Nepal.

Nepalese brands can also depend on the popularity of Indian YouTube influencers to get recognition for themselves. 

Being relatively small, the Nepalese advertising industry is always on the lookout for new avenues to grow. Nepalese brands are utilizing the massive Indian audience on YouTube to raise brand awareness.

As a result, they are willing to pay a premium to Indian YouTube influencers for brand deals that utilize the YouTuber's large reach.

### üåè How to Get Brand Deals in Nepal as an Indian YouTuber






Getting brand deals in Nepal as an Indian YouTuber is no different from getting brand deals in India. In fact, the same methods can be used to land brand deals in both countries.

Indian YouTubers can try reaching out directly to brands to negotiate deals. Another way is to join influencer marketing platforms where they can get matched with brands for sponsorships.

Below are some influencer marketing platforms Indian YouTubers can utilize to land brand deals in Nepal.
