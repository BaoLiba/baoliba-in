India is home to many famous social media platforms, including Moj, which thrives on short videos. Moj influencers have been very popular in their home country and are now beginning to gain traction among Russian businesses.

As Moj influencers are emerging as one of the best brand marketing methods in Russia, we investigate how these influencers crack brand deals in Russia.


## 📢 The Rise of Moj influencers and their popularity in Russia

There are several reasons why Russian businesses and brands are seeking to collaborate with Moj influencers from India.

First, the Moj app is the most downloaded app in India and has around 350 million monthly active users, which has allowed various Moj influencers to build large followings.

Secondly, India and Russia have had strong diplomatic relations for decades, which has provided a foundation for Russian businesses to trust influencers from India.


## 📢 Moj influencers have an edge over TikTok influencers

While TikTok is well-known for its impressive influencer marketing potential, Moj influencers have a significant advantage over their TikTok counterparts.
 
In India, TikTok was banned in 2020 for various reasons, including security concerns. Because of this, the Moj app has become the top short video platform in India, and many Indian influencers have found success on the app.

This trend is being noticed in Russia, where TikTok is still operational. Several Russian brands are switching from TikTok influencers to Moj influencers due to the ban of TikTok in India and the popularity of the Moj app among the Indian population.

Brands like MTS, Aviasales, Zolotaya Korona, and others have all started to work with Moj influencers and ditch their previous collaborations with TikTok influencers.


## 🆕 Moj influencers are more trustworthy

The Indian influencer marketing space is packed with fraud. Many brands have been cheated by fake influencers who flaunt inflated follower counts and engagement rates.

The unique technology behind Moj ensures that the app cannot support fake followers. This means that Moj influencers are less likely to be fake influencers who demand payment for brand collaborations.


## 📢 A Peak Into Moj Influencer Marketing

Moj influencer marketing operates similarly to how other influencer marketing methods work. The only key difference is that Moj influencers specifically create short videos promoting a brand's products or services.

The entire setup is easy. Brands simply reach out to Moj influencers through their emails or DMs, and these influencers create videos showcasing the brand's products or services in an entertaining and engaging manner.


## 📢 Why Russian Brands Prefer Moj Influencers Over Indian Influencers

Even in the case of influencer marketing on Russian soil, Russian brands prefer collaborating with Indian influencers over local Russian influencers.

There are also several reasons for this. 

For instance, the Russian public is quite fond of the Indian culture, which is partly a result of the long-standing diplomatic relations between the two countries.

In fact, there are entire TV channels in Russia dedicated to the showcasing of Indian movies and shows. This penchant for Indian culture has translated to social media, where Russian users prefer seeing Indian influencers over their local influencers.

As a result, brands wishing to engage their local user base target Indian influencers, including Indian Moj influencers.

This trend is being noticed in Russia, where TikTok is still operational. Several Russian brands are switching from TikTok influencers to Moj influencers due to the ban of TikTok in India and the popularity of the Moj app among the Indian population.

Brands like MTS, Aviasales, Zolotaya Korona, and others have all started to work with Moj influencers and ditch their previous collaborations with TikTok influencers.


## 📢 The Payment System for Moj influencer Marketing

In the influencer marketing ecosystem, payments are usually conducted through banking channels. However, the banking relationship between Russia and India is currently strained, which complicates the payment process for Russian brands.

Fortunately, Moj influencers are still able to receive payments for their brand deals. 

Indian influencers typically use platforms like Xpert or Gushcloud to facilitate their brand deals. 

These platforms manage the entire process, from connecting influencers with brands to ensuring that influencers receive their payments in a timely manner.


## 📢 The Future of Moj Influencer Marketing in Russia

The trend of Russian brands collaborating with Indian Moj influencers is expected to continue. 

As Russian brands and businesses continue to seek innovative methods to increase their brand awareness, Moj influencers will certainly be one of their go-to marketing strategies.

Currently, Moj influencers are not as famous as TikTok influencers in Russia, but this is expected to change in the coming years.

The popularity of Moj influencers is expected to grow rapidly, and they are projected to become a leading marketing method by 2025.
