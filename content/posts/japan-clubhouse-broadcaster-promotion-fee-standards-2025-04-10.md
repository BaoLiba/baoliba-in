While Clubhouse is no longer bedecked with the sparkles of newness, it hasn't dimmed entirely in Japan. As an Indian brand looking to collaborate with Japanese Clubhouse influencers in 2025, you'll need to understand how the market on the app works.

If you're still under the impression that Clubhouse is devoid of influencer marketing, you should know that it ranks higher than TikTok for the most influencer marketing activity among Japanese social media platforms. 

Nevertheless, if you want to get the most bang for your rupees, you need to know how much Indian brands are paying to Japanese Clubhouse influencers in 2025.

## üí∞ Influencer Marketing Pricing on Clubhouse in Japan

The average cost of collaborating with a Clubhouse influencer in Japan is around 7 lakh rupees per 60-minute session. As is the case with influencer marketing across all platforms, many factors inform the final fee, ranging from the popularity of the account to the nature of the collaboration.

Some of the variables that can affect pricing include:

- **The profile of the influencer:** If you want to work with a Clubhouse influencer that draws a significant number of listeners, you're going to have to pay a premium. 
- **Type of content and duration:** The type of content your collaboration involves is another huge factor in determining pricing. A sponsored discussion with multiple speakers will cost more than a simple product mention. 
- **Whether it is a single post or part of a series:** If you want a Japanese Clubhouse influencer to do more than one post for your brand, you can negotiate a lower price for each post. 
- **Location:** While many advertising agencies will provide a one-size-fits-all price, you'll find that prices vary by prefecture, with premium markets like Tokyo usually commanding a higher fee.

## üìä Japanese Clubhouse Influencer Pricing Breakdown 

Here are some typical Clubhouse influencer collaboration types and the average pricing you can expect:

- **Product mention:** If you simply want the influencer to mention your product in a discussion, you will pay between 61,000 to 2.4 lakhs. This price will often depend on the product being mentioned. If it‚Äôs a luxury watch, expect to pay the higher end of the scale. 
- **Brand ambassador:** If you want a Japanese influencer to represent your brand on Clubhouse, you can expect to pay between 5.8 lakhs to 9.64 lakhs. 
- **Takeover:** A takeover is when an influencer hosts a session for your brand. This usually costs between 1.2 lakhs to 2.4 lakhs. You may have to pay a higher price if your brand has a lot of influence in Japan. 
- **Event promotion:** If you're hosting an event in Japan, you can expect to pay an influencer between 80,000 to 1.3 lakhs to promote it. 
- **Q&A session:** Frequently a favorite type of collaboration for brands, a Q&A session usually costs between 25,000 to 1.2 lakhs. 
- **Contest:** A contest is a great way to engage the influencer's audience. Expect to pay between 69,000 to 1.5 lakhs for a contest, depending on what's being given away. 

## ‚öñÔ∏è Payment Methods and Tax Considerations for Collaborating With Japanese Clubhouse Influencers 

When collaborating with a Japanese Clubhouse influencer, one of the first things you have to agree to is how the payment will be made. Many Japanese influencers prefer to work with agencies that can handle payment processing for them, particularly those that deal in international payments.

You may find agencies that use crypto payments or stablecoins more accommodating, as Japanese influencers tend to work with Japanese Yen. 

Make sure you're clear in your contract about who will shoulder any fees incurred in currency conversion or fees charged by payment processors. 

When it comes to taxes, Japan utilizes a withholding tax system that collects taxes on payments made to foreign residents. In most cases, 20.42% will be withheld from your payment to the Japanese influencer. 

This means that, if an influencer is charging you 100,000 yen for their services, they‚Äôll only receive 79,580 yen, as the 20.42% withholding tax will be deducted. 

## üí° Make Sure Your Contract Includes These Key Details 

Without a clear and comprehensive contract, you could find yourself at the mercy of a Japanese influencer who fails to deliver the promised results. 

You should always ensure that your contract includes the following key details:

- **Deliverables:** Be as specific as possible about what you want from the influencer. If your contract states that the influencer will mention your product in their segment, but they simply forget to do so, it may be too late to claim a refund or ask for another segment. 
- **Payment terms:** Clearly state how and when payment will be made to avoid disputes later. 
- **Usage rights:**  Specify how long you can use any content produced in your campaign, where you can use it, and if it can be edited or repurposed. 
- **Termination clause:** Always establish how either party can terminate the contract and what will happen if one side fails to uphold their end of the agreement. 

## üì¢ The Importance of Working With a Japanese Influencer Marketing Agency 

As an Indian brand looking to promote on Japanese Clubhouse channels, you'll save both time and hassle working with a Japanese influencer marketing agency. 

Many Japanese influencers are reluctant to work directly with brands. This is understandable, as many will have had past experiences where brands made unreasonable demands or treated them poorly. 

Because of this, they are more likely to want to work with an intermediary, typically an influencer marketing agency, which can be a go-between for them and the brand. 

Moreover, agencies can streamline the influencer selection process, saving you from wasting time with Japanese influencers that don't fit your brand. 

## üìà Popular Japanese Clubhouse Influencers 

Here are some popular Japanese Clubhouse influencers you may want to consider working with in 2025:
