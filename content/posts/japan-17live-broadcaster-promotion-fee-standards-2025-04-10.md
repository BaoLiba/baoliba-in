In India, while we are warming up to the idea of live streaming marketing, Japan is way ahead of us with 17LIVE, the most popular live streaming platform in Japan and even among Japanese audiences abroad.

As part of the vast world of live streaming, 17LIVE influencers are seeing a rise in demand as companies look to them to reach audiences and promote their products and services.

Japan's influencers are being enlisted by companies looking to promote their products and services.

## ðŸ“¢ 17LIVE Influencer Marketing

Companies from various industries, including beauty, fashion, electronics, travel, and food and beverages, are tapping 17LIVE influencers for promotions.

According to Statista, in 2020, the influencer marketing industry was valued at 1.5 billion U.S. dollars, and it is predicted to grow to 4.62 billion dollars by 2025. 

Japan is seen as a significant driver of that growth.

Successful influencer marketing campaigns rely on the influencer's authenticity and ability to engage with their audience. 

With their live videos, 17LIVE influencers showcase products and services in a way that resonates with their audience, driving more leads and sales.

Companies looking to optimize their marketing strategies and gain a competitive advantage can use 17LIVE influencer marketing to reach audiences on their preferred platforms, where they spend most of their time.

With 17LIVE influencers, brands can increase their chances of reaching their target audiences and converting them into customers.

## ðŸ“Š Pricing of 17LIVE Influencers

According to a PR report by lead agency ABCD, 70% of Japanese influencers are making money from their promotions. 

The report showed that they can earn an average of 200,000 yen per month from brand partnerships and sponsorships. Some are even raking in upwards of 1 million yen per month.

In fact, Japanese influencers rank at the top of the world in terms of popularity, viewership, and market value.


17LIVE influencers earn an average of 200,000 yen per month from brand partnerships.

That average income is lower than Japanese native YouTubers, who can earn an average of 500,000 yen per month, but higher than Instagram influencers, who can earn an average of 150,000 yen per month.

When discussing influencer fees, it is essential to understand that there is no single pricing system for them. 

Pricing influences include:

1. **Audience Engagement**: How many of their followers are real? How many of their followers are actually engaged and consuming their content?

2. **Platform**: Different social media platforms have different marketing strategies and algorithms. They also require different skills to create quality content. Therefore, the pricing across platforms will vary.

3. **Content Type**: The type of content an influencer creates also affects their pricing. For instance, how much they charge for live streams compared to static posts or videos.


4. **Brand Fit**: If an influencer aligns with a brand's values, they may be willing to work with them, even at a discounted rate. 

5. **Influencer Level**: Generally, established influencers can charge significantly more than micro-influencers. 

6. **Market Demand**: The demand for influencer marketing in a specific market also affects pricing, as seen with the rise of 17LIVE influencers in Japan.

## ðŸ’¡ How to Work with 17LIVE Influencers
