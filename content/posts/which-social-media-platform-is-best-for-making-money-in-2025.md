# Which Social Media Platform Will Make You The Most Money in 2025?

Social media is a part of your everyday life. Whether it‚Äôs through scrolling on the couch after work or posting a selfie at the beach, social media is where billions share their personal lives, interests, and passions with the world.

Over time, social media has evolved into a tool for businesses to engage with their audiences and for individuals to build their own brands. Some have even made careers out of sharing their lives on social media. 

In fact, a recent study found that over 50% of Gen Zers and millennials want to be social media influencers over anything else. They would choose being an influencer over being a doctor, lawyer, or teacher.

The desire for social media stardom isn‚Äôt going anywhere. As social media continues to grow, so does the opportunity to monetize your influence.

But while social media influencers are promised big checks and free products, the reality is that social media platforms pay their influencers differently. Some platforms are more lucrative than others, and some are harder to break into.

As of 2023, Instagram is the highest-paying social media platform for influencers, but will it still be the best platform to make money in 2025?

Let‚Äôs take a look at which platforms are expected to pay the most in 2025, so you can make the right choice when deciding which social media platform to commit to.


## ü§ë 2025 Will Be The Year of TikTok

TikTok is predicted to make its mark as the best platform for monetization in 2025. The platform has grown immensely over the past few years, accumulating over 1.5 billion users.

Due to its rapidly growing user base, TikTok has also attracted brands looking to advertise their products. In fact, TikTok is projected to surpass Google as the most popular website in 2024.

TikTok has been struggling with monetization compared to Instagram, which is why the platform has made several updates to its Creator Fund. 

While Instagram‚Äôs Creator Fund offers creators a flat rate per post, TikTok allows for more flexibility with how content is shared, making it easier to monetize.

For example, TikTok offers a wider array of content formats to choose from, such as live streams, shoppable posts, and in-feed videos, which can help drive more engagement.

TikTok has also introduced a new marketing tool called the TikTok Shop, allowing users to purchase products directly from businesses‚Äô profiles. 


## üì£ Instagram Will Still Have A Strong Start

Instagram has remained one of the best platforms for social media monetization since its inception.

With over 2 billion active users, Instagram attracts a massive audience for brands looking to advertise their products.

In 2025, Instagram is still predicted to be one of the highest-paying platforms for social media influencers. This is because the platform is constantly evolving and adapting to the needs of its users.

Instagram has also made some changes to its monetization process. Creators can now earn money from live streams and shoppable posts, making it easier for creators to increase their revenue.

Instagram has also launched a new program called Instagram Ads, allowing users to earn a commission for every sale made through their posts.

Instagram is still a popular platform for social media influencers to build their brands and earn money, and it doesn‚Äôt seem like that will change any time soon.


## ü™ô YouTube Monetization is on the Rise

YouTube has always been a dominant player in the social media monetization game, and it will continue to be in 2025.

YouTube is predicted to be more lucrative than Instagram in 2025, with influencers earning an average of $2,800 per post. 

YouTube has made some changes to its monetization process over the years. The platform has introduced ad revenue sharing, allowing creators to earn a portion of the revenue generated from ads on their videos. 

In 2023, YouTube introduced a new program called YouTube Shorts Fund, allowing creators to earn money from short-form videos.

YouTube has also made it easier for creators to monetize their channels. Creators can now earn money through channel memberships, super chats, and merchandise shelf.

With the rise of short-form video content, YouTube is quickly becoming one of the best platforms for social media monetization. 


## üí∏ Facebook Will Fall Behind

Facebook has been one of the biggest players in the social media game since its inception. 

However, Facebook‚Äôs popularity has been declining over the years, especially among younger users. As of 2023, only 26% of teenagers use Facebook, compared to 43% using TikTok. 

This decline in popularity among younger audiences will also be reflected in Facebook‚Äôs monetization opportunities. 

In 2025, Facebook is expected to be the lowest-paying platform for social media influencers, with users earning an average of only $680 per post. 


## üìà Twitter Will Keep Its Ground

Despite Elon Musk's takeover, Twitter, now known as X, is still a popular platform for social media monetization.

In fact, Twitter has been making some changes to its monetization process, introducing features such as super follows and ticketed spaces, allowing creators to earn money from their content.

With 238 million users, Twitter is still relevant and attracts a wide range of audiences for brands looking to advertise their products. 

In 2025, Twitter will still be one of the best platforms for monetization, with influencers earning an average of $1,300 per post.


## üí° Don‚Äôt Forget About New Platforms

While the social media landscape may seem saturated, new platforms continue to emerge, providing fresh opportunities for influencers to monetize their content.

Platforms like BeReal, Twitch, and Clubhouse are gaining traction and may offer more lucrative monetization options in 2025.

BeReal, for example, is a platform that encourages authenticity and spontaneity, which may resonate with audiences seeking a break from carefully curated content.

As these new platforms continue to grow, they may attract brands looking to advertise their products, allowing influencers to monetize their content and build their brands.

## ‚ùó Wrap Up

It‚Äôs important to note that while these platforms may offer more lucrative monetization options, they also require different levels of commitment and effort.

When deciding which platform to commit to, consider your strengths and weaknesses as a creator, as well as your target audience and the type of content you enjoy creating.

Ultimately, the best platform for monetization will depend on your unique circumstances and goals as a creator.
