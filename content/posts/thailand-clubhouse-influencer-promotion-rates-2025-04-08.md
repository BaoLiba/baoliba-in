When it comes to influencer marketing, Thailand gets it.


For instance, a recent report found that Thailand ranked 8th in the world for influencer marketing expenditures per capita, and the country is predicted to increase its spending by 204% by 2025.


This ranking is not so surprising when we consider that Thailand is the birthplace of Clubhouse influencer marketing, as the app has been all the rage among Thai youth, further increasing the demand for Clubhouse influencers.


While Clubhouse influencer marketing might seem straightforward, it is actually rife with variables that can complicate the pricing process.


The rhetoric surrounding Thailand's Clubhouse influencer marketing costs is the same as it is for any other influencer marketing channel; the average cost of a collaboration is determined by the influencer's audience size, engagement rate, and a few other factors.


However, the Clubhouse influencer marketing costing isn't that simple, particularly when we are probing the Thai market.


# ðŸ“Š Thailand Clubhouse Influencer Marketing Pricing Breakdown

Before we venture deeper into the murky pricing variables of Thai Clubhouse influencers, letâ€™s take a look at the range of their marketing rates.


| Collaboration Type | Price in Thai Baht (THB) | Price in Indian Rupee (INR) |
|---------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Clubhouse Room Promo| 5,000 to 15,000 THB | â‚¹11,700 to â‚¹35,200 |
| Clubhouse Room Host | 10,000 to 30,000 THB | â‚¹23,400 to â‚¹70,000 |
| Clubhouse Room Co-Host | 8,000 to 20,000 THB | â‚¹18,600 to â‚¹46,700 |
| Clubhouse Influencer Speaker | 5,000 to 15,000 THB | â‚¹11,700 to â‚¹35,200 |
| Clubhouse Influencer Moderator | 8,000 to 20,000 THB | â‚¹18,600 to â‚¹46,700 |
| Clubhouse Influencer Last Speaker | 3,000 to 8,000 THB | â‚¹7,000 to â‚¹18,600 |

As we can see from the table, the breadth of Thai Clubhouse influencer marketing prices is quite wide, which is indicative of the number of variables that can come into play.

# ðŸ¤” Why Are Thai Clubhouse Influencer Marketing Prices So Varied?

When marketing on Clubhouse, it is essential to understand that the platform is vastly different from other social media apps, which means that traditional influencer marketing metrics are not always applicable.


Here are some factors that heavily influence the pricing of Thai Clubhouse influencers.


## Clubhouse Influencer Audience Size Matters Less


Given that Clubhouse is an audio-based platform, it is impossible for influencers to display a follower count; therefore, brands cannot simply browse an influencer profile to vet their audience.


This lack of transparency is also complicated by the fact that anyone can view a Clubhouse room regardless of whether they are a follower of the moderator or speaker.


Consequently, brands must uncover an influencerâ€™s audience size and quality through a series of private conversations and assessments, which can be labor-intensive.


The result is that Thai Clubhouse influencers can charge high prices without providing any concrete evidence of their follower count.


## Clubhouse Engagement Rates Are No Longer Absolute


Engagement rates are often cited by influencers as the most telling indicator of their potential marketing value.


While engagement rates on visual platforms like Instagram and TikTok can be easily quantified, Clubhouse engagement is much more nebulous.


On Clubhouse, engagement is demonstrated through audience participation and can take the form of questions, public statements, and applause, but quantifying this is nearly impossible.


Therefore, Thai Clubhouse influencers are free to inflate their engagement metrics or leave them completely undefined.


## Trust Is the Most Important Factor

A common problem with influencer marketing is trust on both ends of the marketing pipeline.


Brands need to trust that the influencer will deliver their message and stay on-topic, while influencers must trust that they will receive their full payment upon completion of the collaboration.


Because of its audio-based nature, Clubhouse marketing performances are only recorded within the app, which can put brands at greater risk of receiving poor deliverables.


Consequently, brands must build a greater level of trust with their Thai Clubhouse influencers, and this is commonly established through long-term associations.


Further, influencers can also establish trust by demanding upfront payments and deposits.


### Thai Clubhouse Influencer Marketing Payment Methods


The desire for longer-term collaborative relationships is not the only thing that sets Thai Clubhouse influencer marketing apart; their payment methods do as well.


While it is common for influencers from various countries to accept international monetary transfers through PayPal, Wise, or other channels, Thai Clubhouse influencers typically prefer local payment methods.


For example, they often prefer to be paid by PromptPay, which is an interbank network that allows transfers between all member banks within Thailand.


Consequently, PromptPay fees are typically much lower than fees incurred through international transfers, making it simpler and cheaper for both parties.


In fact, PromptPay can be used for transactions of every size, granting Thai Clubhouse influencers the ability to price their marketing efforts from as little as 1 baht.


Moreover, the Bangkok Bank has set up a system that enables Thai Clubhouse influencers to accept international payments through PromptPay.


This setup allows brands to deposit funds into the influencers' Bangkok Bank accounts through a prompt pay with any bank that is an international member of the PromptPay network.


Overall, this payment processing option drastically increases the appeal of Thai Clubhouse influencer marketing.


# ðŸ’¡ How to Maximize Your ROI with Thai Clubhouse Influencers

No matter where you market or what platforms you use, maximizing your return-on-investment should always be a priority.


Here are some tips for working with Thai Clubhouse influencers.


## Formulate Your Goals

Before you even start contacting Thai Clubhouse influencers, you need to define your goals for the collaboration.


Are you looking to increase sales, brand awareness, followers, or something else entirely?


By setting specific goals, you will be able to find the right influencers for your needs and evaluate their performance with clarity.


## Audit Potential Influencers


Given their ambiguous audience metrics, you should conduct a thorough audit of any Thai Clubhouse influencer before proceeding with negotiations.


You can do this simply by joining their Clubhouse rooms to get a feel for their audience size and engagement, which will allow you to make an informed assessment.


## Create a Clear Contract

A contract is a simple yet effective device that can open the lines of communication between you and the influencer, leading to a better end-product.


Ensure that the contract clearly defines expectations on both sides as well as the payment process and timeline.


## Keep Up Communication

Continuous communication with your Thai Clubhouse influencer will make the collaboration process smoother and more efficient.


Emails, messaging apps, and even calls are good mediums to facilitate conversations and ensure that everyone is on the same page.


## Assess the Results

Once the collaboration is complete, make sure to evaluate its success in relation to your original goals.


Doing so will help you determine if the marketing effort was worthwhile and whether or not you would like to work with the influencer again.
